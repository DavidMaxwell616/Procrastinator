Thousands fled in panic yesterday at the Sunset Diner in Piscataway,
New Jersey as <i>de Mexicano loco el Della Rucho</i> fired his pistol 
into the air, cause intense concern. El Della Rucho, a Mexican
Restaurant owner who has been suing the Mud fraudulent advertising
(i.e. not being Mexican) exploded into violence at the famed
<i>Crudo</i> Stone Free medallion award ceremony when he realized
that the Sunset Diner - a regular Mud haunt - would be receiving
the prestigious award for excellence intoxicating patrons. "This
is the second disrespect they have paid me!" cursed the 
drug-addled miscreant.

Remember that drinks, especially in New York
City, are expensive. Always get drunk before
you get to the bar - especially in NYC where
you have to (and shouldn't) drive to and from
the gigs. When the Mud starts playing your
buzz should be in high gear. You shouldn't
be just standing there, all straight, sipping
your first beer of the night - especially if
it's $5 a beer. With proper pacing you too 
can go for distance. Think about it and bring
a flash! - and some for me too!

Thousands of weirdos collided into innocent
bystanders, spilling their beer, extinguishing
cigarettes and sweating on them, while 
attempting to interpret the message of the Mud
song "The Educated Stumble". The song entreats
the listener entreats the listener to stagger,
sway and lurch about, but achieving a trnscendence
of coordination by never actually becoming
reckless. The concept is to almost, or bang into
anyone (unless they are your friends and dancing too).
Please try to enjoy the song without buzz casualties
and eat a big meal to you'll have plenty to puke
at the end. 
The Mud can be reached for somments for the editors
chose to ignore them.

Now it can be told, the strange saga of lust,
betrayal, death and greed. A story too bold,
too powerful to tell...until now. Now at last
it can be told. Formed in a repressive Syracuse
dorm, see the horrible backlash of freedon tear
their young lives apart. See Jackie Chan as
Dave Parsons. He started out a starry-eyed
innocent deadhead and would up ruling an immense
dynasty of power using nothing but two stron hands
and a head as hard as stone. See Troy McClure as
Don Martin, a hustler, a dealer in everything from
cool tie-dyes to ambitious credibitility, determined
to pay his rent...at any cost. With Yngve Malmsteen
as MarK Czuj the airhead Pole with a heart of gold.
Tom Jones stars as Matt Pedone-he lived the high life-
fast boates, fast cars, homes on Long Island and
Florida. He had it all, and he put it all on the 
line...for love. Special guest Robin Williams stars
as Scott Lehr. Before he came into his life, he was
a wiseass. Soon he became a wiseass with a great girlfriend
with a great girlfriend. See it all, read the horrific
story of the past, of the strange goings on in a college
that by day spawned learning but at night spawned
depravity, violence...outrageous passioned orgies
of alcohol and fleshy sins! Sex was their goal, drugs
their obsession, rock and roll their very LIFE!

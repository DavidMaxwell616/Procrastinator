ROCK UNCOVERED by Patty Headstrong Should up-and-coming bands stick to originals or should they include an occasional off-beat cover? Although the importance of producing and playing original material cannot be denied, there are benefits to playing an occasional well-chosen cover dune. This is especially tnie for bands who are expanding their audience. A familiar song may be just the thing that's needed to draw in that new lace in the crowd and gel thorn out on the dance Door shakin' it When a band plays a song written by another artist, they are paying tribute to that artist, often revealing their own musical influences. By slaking out this common ground they are establishing a connection between themselves and their audience. It is important that cover tunes are carefully selected in order for the band to make a good impression. Current popular songs are probably not the wisest choice for a band to reproduce. Instead, bands may want to consider something that is slightly off the beaten path while at the same time recognizable. Mother important consideration is the manner in which the tune is played. It would seem rather redundant and uncreative for a band to play an exact replica of an original song. The idea behind doing a cover is to introduce the now band's style of playing through means of a familiar melody. Some bands individualize tho sounds of their cover songs no much, however, that they eventually change the lyrics and call the song their own. The cover song can serve as a vehicle for the up-and-coming band to catch the audience's attention and give the audience a way to assess their skill and potential. Patricaa Headstrong is a sweet tongued Bourbonite from Connecticut whose interests include infantile Puerto Rican gangsters and wild-eyed drummers.

AGRIBUSINESS by Lula May Appleby In rodays's modem world, 'minting' something for all you can is scan as a neganve, even parasitic, behavior. But in an agrarian society, hating your owes cow to milk as you please mmos status. A good cow means security. And just as it's part of nature's plan that certain mammals, at remain times, produce life giving milk, it's also part of nature's plan that human beings should sustain and enrich each other. 
We shouldn't feel guilty about accepting liquid commodities from each other. And if you worry that you may have taken advantage of someone, put look at it like this: you can't be there to protect thus person all the rime, and if they choose (at least semi-lucidly) to squander their resources on you • then you're probably fulfilling a part of their personal drama - and if is uasn't you riding off in the sunset with a pint of buttermilk, it would be someone else. 
MORAL FOR WOMEN: Why buy milk when you can have the cow? MORAL. FOR MEN: Give a girl a glass of milk and she'll drink for the day. Give her a cow and she won't need you anymore.

PROCRASTINATOR VIDEO PICK OF THE MONTH: BAD LIEUTENANT (1992, D.A. Ferrara) 
A drug movie for the nineties, an odyssey of in and redemption, with a tour.de-force performance by Harvey Keitel. This is the movie you can't wait to show your grandchildren and drool on them saying, 'Seel See/ This is how it really wasl• Keitel plays a heavily hallucinating cop site drifts through his day shooting up, snorting, smoking, gambling and drinking, not to mention dancing naked and sexually harassing minors. If au cops got away with this, I'd sign up right away! The plot concerns nu questionable attempt at redemption while •investigating• the tortme/rape of a nun in Spanish Harlem. What occupies Yokel's mind mom, though, is the fare of the Dodgers in the NBA play-offs, on whom he's her a small fortune. The whole movie seems like it's on drugs; it offers the audience a good contact bums. Keitel's character 4 atypical of the usual shoot.ern up and cat chase movie cop in than he is virtually indistinguishable from she villains. He has no hardass sargeant who suspend, him for insubordination. He has no honest, hardworking partner or spouse to play the pro-sobriety/decency role. His only love interest is the heroin he smokes with his junkie girlfriend. We watch Kcitel sway back and forth, his face suffused with stoned erstarg. The mwk floats around in a hue, and when our hero hallucinate, Pula it not only comes as no surprise, it's hysterical. Haney lake! 4 a dynamo that more than makes up for the film's slaws (The Ittadi•carn man's shakes, the rape victim nun who looks like she just came off a Cosmopolitan magazine cover). Keitel take, his Martin SCOOCK school khtick of tough guy Italian monster to ludicrous heights and hangs up there for the whole picture!!!

          <p class="justify">It has been clinically proven that individuals afflicted with contradictory doubleness of thought, speech or action may aggravate employers/work associaates, mate or peers, and eventually muddle their children and become religiously/ethically ambiguous.
            Very few professionally or maritally successful people have vaguely defined character structures. It has been suggested that by choosing sides and adhering vehemently, one can avoid forever remaining an irresolute shadow of what one could have been.

<h1>Shopping For A New Defense Mechanism</h1>
<br>
<p class="justify">Well, 1995 is here. With the the new year here, it is time to reevaluate our lives. A chance to become closer to estranged friends and relatives and to shower your beloved with 
  good cheer. However, it is also a time of short fuses, chain yanking relatives, and market instability. All of which can lead to manic, ulcerating stress. There are a number of ways to cope with 
  claustrophobic stress sources. Listed below ate a few current models:<br><br> 



The Lagreco "Margaret Dumont Apathy" model<br>
   This cheek-turner offers the user the ability to discern well-intentioned, constructive criticism from insecurity-driven, scapegoat-seeking barbs, and ignore both. (Intoxicants not included)<br><br>
The Kuersten "Wasn't me" model<br> This year's top selling model is perfect for adolescent wannabes who strive to feel foppishly independent. Works well on gullible and garrulous types.<br><br>
The Lehr "Tenacious Needling" model<br> This is one of last years big sellers. It functions by working up to a week a time valiantly trying to outdo the provocateur<br><br>
Some Other Popular models:<br>
   The Max "laughing on the outside, seething on the inside" model<br>
    The Parsons "Phase Out" model<br>
    The Tesauro "Sicilian Look of Death" model<br>
    The Martin "I don't get it" model<br>
    The Czuj "Confuse 'em with schwanglyisms" model

        Have you ever been in a trendy restaurant in the East Village and have bumped into someone who 
        looked at you with a disdainful, how-dare-you-even-occupy-4-seconds-of-my-already-overbooked-time look?
        Your mind strained 10 attain some plausible identification and in your confusion, they deftly floated out of view into a crowd of bedazzled gawkers. Hours later it dawned on you that the person was no celebrity at all but just another New Yorker falsely convinced of some self-appointed fame. 
        It's tne New York attitude times ten. With Hollywood hotspotter Chaim K. Ottick's new pamphlet "Myself, My Fan Club, and I" ($19.95, Rynodix Publications) you can learn the skills of self-adoration from those who don't need wealth, 
        papparazzi and talent to feel famous. In it you can learn:
        <br><br> 
        1. How to act rudely to waiters and not get your food spat on!<br>
        2. Haw to convert a beer gut from a gluttonous burden to a status symbol!<br>
        3. Proper maitre d' greasing techniques. (including the phone brought to table play)...Fake Cellular phone included!

          <h1>New York - 
          The peevish hells of every day existence: 
          </h1><h2>Global melting pot emits toxic odors. Free enterprise of the panhandler. Do all beggars have HIV? Subway evangelists. Who invited all the tourists? 
          </h2><p class="justify">If any of you Speak Japanese, French, Spanish, Chinese or any of the languages being muttered over the incessant honking of cab horns, please 
          feel free to inform these tourists that the places upon which they are standing, looking up at buildings, turning around in circles like dizzy weebles, 
          are known in America as sidewalks. Please point out that the second half of that term implies motion, usually forward with some predetermined destination. 
          And although it could be argued that spinning around gazing at building tops indeed implies motion, I doubt that the presentation of that argument would stop me 
          from trying to will these human pedestrian barriers into tne path of a crazed taxi driver. Can I still call them cab drivers? PC, you know. I think they might be 
          public transportation engineers these days.<br><br>
          If you can finally get through the damn tourists, be prepared to be next assaulted by some enterprising panhandler, pleading with you for some spare change so that 
          they might eat today. It's an emotional moment, until the cheap rye is detected on the breath. The unfortunate bastard in front of you assures you that he is HIV 
          positive and has been unable to receive help from the government. The lying bastard reeks of booze and he's accosting me on my way to the job I despise, 
          for which I trudge my way through these bastards five days a week so that I might afford to catch the buzz this leech is sporting at nine in the morning. Of course 
          it never occurs to me at the moment of confrontation to ask how many times he shot up with dirty needles before he contracted the deadly disease.<br><br>
          You've finally gotten away from the beggar without him spitting on you, just in time for the walk sign to turn deep red as you step down into the street to cross. 
          It chuckles at you as it grins from ear to ear with "DON'T WALK". You look at your watch to see how long it's taken you to walk that brutal half a block, when you 
          are shoved from behind, almost falling in front of a quick moving cab. You turn around to see a rather unapologetic swine with fresh out of the box roller blades 
          laced to his feet. The fucker is learning how to roller blade during rush hour on a busy sidewalk. Par for the course, he can hardly stand, never mind stop on his own accord. But what
          the hell, if he wasn't on the sidewalk, flailing around accosting pedestrians, he'd be in the road, taking up a lane of traffic and causing the harried anxiety of a feeding frenzy 
          among the motorists.<br><br>
          The smart ass crossing post finally has annoyed you enougn and turns green. You are almost there. The entrance to the subway is close. You'll finally be underground, away 
          from the insanity of the street.<br><br>

          <p class="justify">Think again. The tunnel is about twenty degrees warmer than your health club's sauna and by the number of people on the platform you suspect that the trains are not running, 
          or at least not free of complications. Just as you've resigned yourself to the only slightly comforting notion that it couldn't possibly get any worse, a black woman in her early 
          forties starts caterwauling at the top of her lungs "God will strike you down, sinners. The end is near. Repent now or feel the wrath of God Almighty!" What did I do to piss off God 
          recently? It must have been relatively serious, because he punishes me daily. C'est la vie. Another day in the big siren saturated flashing lights of the not so bright city.

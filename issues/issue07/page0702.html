          <h2>WELCOME, OVERLORDS OF UNDEREXERTION</h2>
          <p class="justify"> This month we hope to inform as well as entertain fellow Procrastinators with some facts about the Mud's homebase: 
            The thriving metropolis of Manhattan. I have squeezed my uberlethargic staff for superficial research, tepid critiques, unrelated digressions, 
            and uninspired philosophies on city culture. As the editor of the Procrastinator. I accept nothing but mediocrity for my catatonic 
            audience. I thank you.

                I hide past blue into dark gray shadow and wish that I could stay that way but no I'm bound to float back up, 
                annoyed at my hungry, screaming lungs. I dream that I could needn't breathe to sleep so still beneath their feet, 
                these bathers standing next to me, shrilly shrieking pool-side sonnets, bopping beachballs, splashing, thrashing 
                toothless sharks in feeding frenzy, limbless neverland is not to be, this carnivore who swims in me is locked in 
                glass and can't swim free past humanness to lash as it would like, to strike. 
              <br><br>
              To snap the Sun in two halves and laugh at the ensuing darkness. Ha!

        <h1> MANHATTAN MUD BAND</h1> 
        <h2>The Rants Of A Stoned Accountant</h2> <br>
        <p class="justify">
          Long ago in a place not so far away, the Mud was spawned in the veins of the Stones, Allmans, and Chicago covers. 
          Ahh, the humble beginnings. Hector was everywhere. There was scarcely a surface to which Hector didn't affix himself. 
          (He did have a little help from the faithful servants of Mud propaganda) Where is Hector Agave now? 
          Exiled to on occasional appearance in this here tribute to the slacker? Oy Vey!
         <br><br> 
          The influence of this Utopia, this slackers' paradise has been good to the Mud. 
          It no longer resembles the slow-mud of soon to he adobe huts, but more stinks the funk of Manhattan grime; 
          mud laid to rest on this city's strets by a Jersey Jeep with oversized tires 
          (or was it a beat up Dodge named Beaullah?). This Mud takes comfort in the trenches of degradation it has come to know as home.
           The bustle of the village on a warm spring night fosters the frenzy for butt shaking. Cheers! 
           I've been accustomed to being the dancing fool Fronk sang of (less of course the spoon for my nose) 
           Why not? 
           "Don't hold back" wasn't coined for nought!
           <br><br> How the weather wears at the surface. To leave the fair city behind once the eyes have feasted upon life? Yeah, when apricots bloom. 
           The breeze, heavy with the summer's sweet smell of urine, carries the rhythms of distant and not so distant cultures. 
           Resurgence of a mindset almost lost long ago is taking place on the very streets where the mud rest omongst two hundred dollar shoes and dirty syringes. 
           A resurgence of a time when music was a soul's facial expression presenting itself. Nice mugs, boys...Yikes!
           <br><br>
            The groove is strong and getting stronger every day. There are some good bands out there, kids. Enjoy it! (Remember the eighties? It could be that bad again some day.) 
            So get out there all you slackers! Shake your Potato'in Lazy Boy asses and support the Mud and all the other great acts this city's streets have to offer. 
            Exposure to elements is good. Don't overexert yourself, of course. The slack must be cherished like a fine bourbon.

          <h1 class="sans">NEW YORK: A Slacker's Heaven or Hell?</h1> 
          <p class="justify">
          To the unfamiliar, New York City doesn't seem to be the sort of place where a slacker can really slack off: 
          High Rent, Smog and Traffic. The "fast-paced" lifestyle just doesn't seem compatible with the slacker lifestyle. 
          Why is it, then, that New York City is slacker heaven?
          Why isn't the most slack found in Telluride, Colorado?
          Well, John, there might be mare trees out there, but far less pretty women. You and your ski-burned cronies sit 
          around in front of the TV all day. The "mountain" is closed and there ain't no woman in miles. In New York, there 
          so much to do that even sitting on your couch feels more dangerous than skiing. 
          <br><br>
          In New York, nothing is banal, so even banality becomes something to be treasured. Where elsen can 
          you a drunken fight, six gorgeous models, three homeless junkies and four millionaires converging on street corner all in one minute, and still feel bored?
          </p>
          <h3>Still feel proud to be bored by the biggest, loudest city in the world? 
          </h3><br>
          <p class="justify">
            Take a typical Friday night for the Procrastinator staff, the Mud, and our friends. Say the Mud has the night off and we're all going to see Milo Z at 
            The New Music Cafe. First, we meet at Max's for some shots of whiskey. Suddenly, it is very late. Milo doesn't even go on until one, and it's already 12:59!! 
            It's far too late to go out, that's what I say. I'm already too wasted to want to go out. They drag me there anyway. I'm bitching and moaning but then Milo 
            comes on and I'm suddenly a dancing fool. Now it's 4am and we're standing out on the street, drinking beers from the deli across the street. Now I'm wide awake. 
            It's 2 hours past closing for any other bar in the world and we end up in some ultra-friendly bohemian type place. I get home around 6 am. 
            <br><br>Do you think you could stay out all night without really wanting to be anywhere else but New York? No, in fact just to go out at all anywhere else 
            you need more energy than a New York slacker. You know how weak the scene will be. You'll stand around, waiting for a 3 chord wonder band to come on. You'll 
            stare forlornely at one pretty girl, bitterly at her five boyfriends, anxiously at the ball game on the big TV screen. You then wander home, deeply depressed,
            hoping you make it home in time for the late news... or the tail end of Letterman. 
            <br><br>
            New York is also perfect for the slacker because it puts everything of your fingertips. Literally, because although everything is a block away, you don't even have to 
            leave your apartment to get it. In other towns you can get a pizza delivered. Here you can get your laundry, whiskey, meals, groceries, dope, videotapes and more whiskey 
            delivered! And picked up! You never have to leave your couch except maybe to go to the bathroom.
            <br><br>
            New York: It's loud and it's not always nice. But that just gives the slacker more of On excuse to stay in his room and read comic books. 
            Then, when he's finally brave enough to venture out: Right around the time any Other town would be closing down, New York is kicking in, with gas.

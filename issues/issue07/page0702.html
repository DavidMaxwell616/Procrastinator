            <br>
           <p class="justify">Vitamins and an all vegetarian diet are just two of methods that Dave Parsons, esq., has adopted to prevent any further recession of his hairline. "If it goes, I'm going with it," declared a defiant Parsons after emerging from a grueling 10-hour Hair Club for Men sales pitch.

          <br>
          <p class="justify">Upon learning that too much animal protein is a factor in hair loss, Parsons has recently bought a five pound bag of rice, which he plans to consume in its entirety. "No more hamburgers for me," vowed the courageous star. We can only pray that these drastic measures will help in his desperate, valiant struggle.

              <h3 class="sanscenter">I lived with a toilet paper junkie!</h3>
        <p class="justify">Procrastinator managing editor and publisher Max Von Cider endured a traumatizing and gut wrenching two month ordeal last summer, as he reveals in his book "The Bourbon Myth", due for release in July (Batchog Books, $19.95). Apparently Mr. von Cider took in a friend who he calls "Derek Corstin" to stay with him while between apartments, 
          jobs and girlfriends. Throughout the weeks that followed, Max gradually became aware of a sickening penchant for bathroom tissue that his roommate had been hiding for years. As the exorbitant supply of toilet paper diminished and the financial burdens became unignorable, Max approached the reclusive Corstin, who nervously avoided the issue. 
          Soon Max noticed various videotapes in Corstin's collection which showed people dressed up in Snuggles and Brawny costumes and engaged in strange, pagan cleaning rituals. As the days progressed, Corstin's illness grew to sickening proportions. 
          "I can almost sympathize with him." Says Max, "I myself have felt the pull of the roll after a Benny Burrito's binge, but Jeez, he was up to a six pack of triple-ply Scott's a day."

          TEA-KETTLE SEIZES MUSIC SCENE!<br><br> 
          <p class="justify">The tea-kettle in the home of Dave and Erich is a loud one with a whistle that stuns out low and quickly begins to skyrocket up octave-after-octave in a beautifully steady. shriller-by-the-second hunt that must be heard to be believed. and "sure as hell gets you movin. into the kitchen to cum it off', as Erich would say. 
      <br><br>      The Kettle, which recently issued a 3-song demo emitted "I'm-a Kettle You. Charlie Manson," is currently considering numerous contract offers. A hot property vocally. the kettle has thus far been offered jobs currently being held by Chris Barron. Anthony Keidis. Eddie Vedder and Milo Z. Is it little wonder them, that the Mexican Mud-whose front-man Scott Lehr has been getting uppity lately-have joined the bidding war? "Yeah, and we'll win." noted Dave. 'because I own the rights to that kettle - and that's that." 
      <br><br>     And that's a big kettle of fish for a nervous Mr. Lehr to lug to the laundry". as Granny would say. Granny was a bit senile.

              <h2 class="invertsans">JERSEY DEVIL TO INFEST BIG APPLE</h2> 
<p class="dbl">Scott Lehr is finally moving out of his parents' house to live in New York City. 
  Unfortunately, he has no job and no apartment, so the big questions are when? Why? How? Many citizens
   of the city that never sleeps are already planning on moving as far away as Chappaqua in order to avoid eye-contact with the leering, red-eyed rapper they've known only as the "Jersey Devil."
  <br><br>"I have until he signs a lease, this could be months away," theorized a frightened cab driver. "Then I om going to get in my cab and head west like a bat out of hell. My biggest fear is that he will get in my cab and want me to take him somewhere. I hear he's a lousy tipper."<br><br>
   Many of the Devil's comrades in slack are also up-in arms. One was heard to voice a fear that they would be summoned to help him move in. Another quaked at the notion he would be borrowing video tapes and never returning them. 
   All we know for sure is that, job & apartment or not, the Jersey Devil has his round eye set on New York, so be vigilant. Protect thy flask!

TRACY MEASY: BLONDE BRAWLER?
<p class="justify">After a messy divorce from aging rock icon, Marmaduke Starr, the notorious Measy has been seen carousing late night in just about every downtown club in New York. 
  A voracious appetite for free beer and attention drives her on past any point of coherence. And after consuming her fill, she is known to get surly and has her share of barroom brawls. 
  Last week she was seen attacking a sidewalk outside a prestigious midtown jazz club. "She's a little girl," noted one black-eyed club owner who asked that his name be witheld for fear of Measy's vengeance. "but she sure can hit."<br><br> 
"She makes Shannon Doherty seem like a nun," observed a drunken admirer. What this erratic behavior stems from, only her therapist knows for sure. But one thing you can be sure of, wherever she goes, there's bound to be men with money, or influence over bartenders. 
And, if there is a band, she will be on the guest list.

        LAGRECO NOT DEAD?</b>

        Startling photograph reveals that former Syracuse Cannabis Legend is still alive and quite happy in secluded Colorado alien bunny farm.</i></h3>

          John (Bunhyhugger) Lagreco, who was presumed dead (and hoped eaten alive by giant scorpions), since 1991, when he disappeared into the Rockies with a 16 pound bag of pea bud and a greasy air mattress, was spotted by a tourist
           last month parading through a small town in Colorado with a consortium of "bunnies". Medium Sashi Vankara, after fondling the picture for an hour, murmured "I feel that John is not aware ot his surroundings. 
           He was obviously abducted by aliens and he has since been learning from them; perfecting his snowboarding techniques and anesthetizing himself to suppress the guilt over his wasted college education."<br><br>
           Procrastinator reporter Chui Gummer flew out to Resin Gulch, Colorado to investigate. Resident stoners denied any knoetedge of the parade and the aien bunny cult, although they exhibited a profound interest in Gummer's fluorescent pen. 
           We were able to locate what is believed to be Lagreco's air mattress, which was being used at a local Pizza Hut to keep the ovens greased. Local authorities believe that Lagreco may have actually smoked himself out in the wilderness, 
           driven mad by a ferocious THC jones. A partially burned letter written in Lagreco's childish scrawl was found in a pile of ashes outside Resin Gulch, next to abandoned, worthless diploma, which was being used as a "sesh" tray.<br><br>
            A transcript of the letter is on the following page.

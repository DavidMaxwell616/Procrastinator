          <p class="justify">Addictions, let me tell you about'em you can't live with'em and you can't live without'em. The ones you hate you always seem to do, the ones you like you always do times two. 
          Well, at least that's how it is out here in a western resort town. It's kinda like college without class or homework. Out here people are addicted to partying, not one drug but them all. 
          People are always saying; whaddya got? Let's go smoke one! Do you want a bump? or who's buying the shots?
           I mean what about the "Ive been drunk and wasted for weeks" hangover. The cure: More. Avoid: Less. Now that's addiction. It's for this reason that my resort town has the rudest locals. You see we rage! 
           We're no Aspen or Vail where the rich & sober flock. But yet these people have addictions as well.

      Addictions are all relative. Someone can be addicted to drugs while someone else one be addicted to a rich and ridiculous lifestyle. "Honey, can you run to the store and get some caviar? 
      This wine just doesn't seem the same without it." What about the sugar junkie? They're always going koo-koo for Cocoa Puffs. There are also the adrenaline junkies. These people live on fear of death but they close out Fear ride the chance of death out. 
      They might do N20 Bunjy Jumps, snowboard off 50' cliffs or freefall and pull the cord at the last minute 100 ft before the ground.<BR> 
      Whatta rush!! There are many things to be be addicted to but addictions can be a problem as well, especially when they interfere wish your normal day life. Such as late for work, too high, to deal with work or drowsiness and impaired coordination at work. 
      Although addictions can cause problems, these problems can be separated by mental addictions and physical addictions

      Most people are mentally addicted to something, such as the chocolate lover, Simpsons fanatic, Mexican Mud Band followers and the infamous wasabi overdosers. 
      Problems that occur with these addicts would probably be lowered sperm count, weight trouble, constant Simpsons quoting, rec-occurring Dave Parsons fantasies and a runny nose at the table with your peers. 
      These problems are far less severe than ones accompanied by physical addictions. These could be withdrawal symptoms, D.T's, shaky coordination (esp. w/chopsticks) or even prenatal infant addiction. These people would even sell their Mud CD "Now With More Salt" 
      for another fix. I mean they're so far gone that a placebo would get them high. The severity of both problems will always depend on the individual case. Each person should look at their addictions 
      and decide whether or not it is a desire or a dependence. For instance,

  when I look at my personal case study I realize I have a close clean relationship with desired intoxicants. 
  I mean I'm in control but I do have certain incidents where it is questionable (i.e. crashing a mountain bike into a parked car coming home from the bars, 
  flushing eyeglasses down the toilet while vomiting, being carried out of the bar from falling down on 'ludes and the rest are all documented in "The Life and Times of John LaGreco". Gimme a break, even Homer Simpson 
  puts his bowling ball in the fridge. Although these things sometimes I'm still on top of things. Some people say don't do drugs, don't eat red meat, exercise, and stay healthy. 
  This is good advice for some, but for the young person who wants to have fun and not worry about things so much, I say "eat well, stay fit, die anyway." 
  Rage on my friend and save your worries for when you hit 40. Then again, who's right, who's wrong and who cares.

          <p class="justify">Q. Dear Ida,<br>
             I just love the Mud band. I see them everywhere they play. I think Don is the neatest. 
             But I'm worried if I stare at Don's pens will I get pregnant?<br>
              curiously,<br>
              Annie "Buddy" Wannanabi<br><br>

            A: Dear Annie,<br>
            I'm glad you asked that question. Let's just say I know how you feel. Don't worry, I must remind you that your hormones might have a tendency to get out of whack. Though you can't get pregnant 
            by looking at a pens, you could be be on your way to ruin. My advice is when you see Don, run up to him and demand that he play something by the Romantics. 
            If he is still looking at you, tell him that you think Seth played much better and was cuter to boot! Believe me, you won't ever get pregnant that way. Scott is a different story - and an entirely separate entity.<br><br>
            Q: Dear Ida,<br>
             Can you clear up an argument I'm having with my sister? I say that Dave from MMB is the same guy who played keyboards for GWAR. My sister says he was a student from "Drexel's Class". Could you please clear this up?<br>
             Confused,<br>
             Evie Breethers<br><br>
              A: Dear Evie,<br>
              Well, I'm sorry, but you're both wrong. Dave from the Mexican Mud Band was seen regularly on the Robin Byrd show "Bang Your Box" dancing to his own renditon of "Love Hangover" by Diana Ross. Scott Lehr was a member of GWAR 
              and played Jimmy on Fox TV's "Drexel's Class". You can now see them both at Desmond's Tavern on Thursday nights.

    <h1 class="sans">SOBESKY OR DOPESKY?</h1>
     
    <p class="justify">
      Sobriety has been an important part of the lives of many 
      American youths since teetotalling became popular in the,
      "after school special"/"Just say Nancy" era of the early
      '80s. But this phenomenon becomes much more troublesome 
      and intriguing when it hits close to home, and affects one 
      of the prominent party people ad well know n hedonists:
      The irreverent Stephen J. Koffman. So I believe the question
      must be asked: Sobeski (slang word for a sober person) or 
      dopeski (slang word for an idiot)?<br><br>
      
      Stephen Koffman, otherwise known as Steve Bro, the Brahmin
      or Reverend Bra of the Church of Love, has, as he calls
      it, gone Sobeski. After graduating from college and indulging
      in the many pleasures of his west coast homeland, he took 
      a job at a private school in the quiet hills of western 
      Massachusetts. The Desisto School, famous for the 
      emotionally disturbed, socially inept, and maniacally stupid 
      student body, is the place he now calls home. This two year 
      pact with the devil was allegedly brought on by the constant
      incomprehensible babble of his longtime nemesis and braincell
      contortionist, John Lagreco (discussed in the most recent 
      issue of the PROCRASTINATOR). "I think he snapped his pea 
      brain," said Lagreco - his one-time partner at the infamous 
      Church of Love - "but he should fit right in." This seems 
      to be the consensus of those who know him as well as the 
      inner circle of the Mud family. "It's like a cult. He's 
      about one sandwich away from a picnic," says Matt Pedone, 
      long time drummer and sandwich eater. Yes, he may be on the
      edge, and friends and family are concerned.
      <br><br>
      Koffman has taken many steps to rid himself of his recent 
      implements of destruction: "the demon weed" and the 
      "oh-so-potent-firewater". In fact, he is on the twelve step
      program and receives weekly psychiatric evaluations. The 
      questions friends are asking is, why? "Drugs are the least 
      of his problems," said the usually reticent Darren Barrett, 
      "actually I always thought they helped."
      <br><br>
      What people must understand is that this is a job and it is
      in no way an easy job to do, especially for Steve Bro. He is
      merely trying to instill higher moral values in the lives of 
      confused youths. "That's a crock," says Dave Parsons, guitar 
      player and velcro enthusiast, "he's just trying to score with 
      the young girlies." Yes, it is hard to believe and even harder
      to understand. Steve Bro may be confusing the school's beliefs 
      with his own, and this is very similar to what happens in a cult.
      <br><br>
      Koffman has been seen at various Mud shows preaching and 
      discussing his new found beliefs. "I'm on a frank and beans 
      diet now because the school is celebrating David Koresh month,"
      he was recently misquoted while showing the band a pamphlet he 
      was reading called Guns, Power, God and Chicks. People just smile,
      nod and walk away, but that is no different from his college 
      days. "Why would anyone want to be sober," said Dr. Twilight 
      while peering over his half empty flask of bourbon, "you got 
      any chaser for this?" Indeed, that is the question we face: 
      Where is the chaser and what happened to Steve Bro?
    <br><br>  
      We believe that he will be fine and this phase will pass 
      with minimal damage done. He will gain a lot of experience from 
      his job, and be drunk and stupid in no time at all. But as 
      the weekend comes to a close, and he drives slowly back to 
      western Massachusetts, the question still lingers: Sobeski 
      or Dopeski?        </p></div>

          <h2><u>SLACKER'S GUIDE TO LIFE</u></h2>
          <p>Follow these 5 simple steps and join the lifestyle people are calling 'the easiest lifestyle of the nineties!'
          <br> 
          <h3>1. GOOD HYGIENE, DIET AND EXERCISE</h3>
          <p class="justify">
            All very important and all too often ignored 
            by the amateur slacker. These three are the 
            hardest things to keep up on when one is 
            devoting oneself full-time to slacking. 
            Remember to cut your nails at least once 
            a week TOENAILS TOO. Even as I'm writing this
            I notice that my fingernails have been ignored
            too long, their tips hit the keys, bothering 
            me, but the effort to reach for the clipper is
            too much. I prefer to suffer, as would any 
            slacker. Showering should be thought about for
            at least an hour before it's done, and then the
            shower itself should take at least as long as 
            the waiting. During the shower you should spend
            lots of time staring at your feet while the 
            water pummels your head. You should be thinking
            about why you lose your car keys all the time.
            If you must shave, use a razor. Always brush, 
            using a painless toothbrush with non-abrasive 
            paste. As for diet: carrots, bananas and peanut
            butter will provide you with all the nutrients
            you need cheap, plus the carrots and bananas
            can be moved easily, eaten easily, while making
            little mess or trash. (The peel's 
            biodegradable!) The rest of your daily required
            calories should be consumed in beer and whiskey.
            <br><br>
            Exercise too can take many forms. Watching 
            television is about the only excercise a true 
            slacker enjoys, but early morning and evening
            hamstring stretches, a few pushups, sit-ups, 
            one or two half-assed pulls at free weights, 
            all help to stave off the eventual slacker 
            physical  deterioration into that of Homer 
            Simpson. Walking, especially to and from the 
            bar, is healthy for more reasons than one. 
            Running, especially from muggers, cops, 
            ugliness and responsibility, is good for the 
            heart, as is dancing. Dancing is a great 
            exercise all-too often unpracticed, especially 
            by the sober and the ungraceful. Everybody 
            should dance, and not just during the second 
            set...I mean all the time.

            <br><br>2. MONEY. MUSIC & MINGLING<br> 
            Money is essential to slackerhood. If you don't
            have a trust fund, you might have to get a job.
            Don't be too scared, though. You know how to 
            slack off, and that knowledge will get you 
            entrenched somewhere, pushing some sort of 
            pencil, if you're lucky. Do you know how to 
            tie a tie? I don't. I have to get my roommate 
            to help me every time I get another interview.
            Forget about work! The real money is in music. 
            Music is big bucks, baby. It's the only thing 
            that isn't bad for you that you enjoy. 
            Resisting the urge to buy too many CD's is 
            very important. They're very expensive. Music 
            is a seductive force, leading us into the hands
            of Satan. We abandon ourselves to the inner 
            forces and enjoy it. Similarly, mingling, 
            flirting, etc. is harmless and enjoyed by all. 
            You can't catch any STD's or flak from mingling. 
            Maybe you get a few phone numbers but you never
            call them. It's a fun sport, but remember to
            play right. Here's a pointer or two: Try to
            keep your mouth closed when you're not talking.
            Check your breath and hair regularly (see: 
            Hygiene). 
          </p>          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p class="justify">Remember, mingling isn't an art, 
              it's accidental, natural, like steam coming 
              out of an open sewer. Until you know just who
              you are, don't be yourself. Many slackers have
              never been themselves. Personally, when I'm 
              mingling I tend to be Grandpa Simpson, or Troy 
              McClure. Whoever you are, remember, nobody 
              wants to hear how tired you are, how much your 
              lip hurts, or how much you hate your boss. 
              Problems should be saved for a rainier day and 
              the urge to whine and bitch should be 
              suppressed, lest you extinguish the flickering 
              flame of happiness as it burns in the hearts 
              of your fellow minglers.</p>            
              <h3>3. SEX, DRUGS & MORE DRUGS</h3> 
            <p class="justify">
              The hardest thing slackers have to do is to 
              remember and put on condoms. In initial sexual
              encounters, especially if drugs and alcohol are
              involved, the act of putting on a condom is so 
              out of sync with normal, marvelous "flow" of 
              nature that it's almost impossible. Many single
              males are afraid to carry condoms for fear that
              they will "jinx" themselves. For this reason 
              there should be condoms in every bedroom. When 
              it comes to using one, it's better that the 
              female puts it on. Remember, this is the 
              nineties, and death is always in the room with 
              you, so get used to him. Hear his voyeuristic 
              pantings and remain unmoved. Men should bear 
              in mind that life's not about sex so much as 
              "contact" or "intimacy". Sex is just the 
              physical expression of a spiritual experience. 
              Another big spiritual enlightener amongst the 
              slackers is drugs. With pot becoming more and 
              more de-demonized, the slacker suffers from 
              red eyes and brain death with less 
              embarrassment than ever before. Remember to 
              check for seeds and if the bag looks short, 
              demand a weigh-in. Many slackers also enjoy 
              such stimulants as mushrooms, ecstasy, LSD, 
              and toad-secretions. Take these in little 
              amounts first, because potency varies 
              incredibly with each batch. Start out small 
              and work your way up to the hallucinations 
              you desire. As for "harder" substances, such 
              as cocaine, crack and heroin, if you must 
              take them, don't make it a habit or you will 
              be very sorry. Stick to pot, it's better for 
              you than anything, even alcohol.<br>
              <br>
              Ah, Alcohol: savior of slackers, water of life,
               destruction in the guise of an angel. Whiskey 
              is the devil, yes indeed. If you don't drink, 
              you better have something else to do, or life 
              can get quite boring. Drinking should begin 
              after work, or anytime after noon on the 
              weekends, unless you don't awake until after 
              noon, in which case you should have something 
              to eat first. Eat something substantial, too, 
              like pasta. Start with beer, then switch to 
              shots of Jaegermeister, or Turkey when you get 
              to the bar. Remember: liquor after beer, you're
              in the clear. Or is it the other way around? 
              Just don't mix too much. Mixing hard alcohols, 
              i.e. a shot of tequila and a shot of Jaeger, 
              is strongly discouraged. Tequila and wine are 
              the most dangerous to combine. To further 
              reduce your chances of getting a hangover, 
              try holding off drinking for an hour or so 
              before retiring. Drink a huge glass of water 
              instead, and take some Vitamin B-12. Getting 
              drunk every weekend is a requirement for 
              successful slackerhood. The goal is to stretch 
              the weekend longer and longer, until Tuesday 
              is the only day of the week left. This can 
              have bad long term effects, including brain, 
              heart, liver, kidney and colon problems. If 
              you drink excessively, you might want to dry 
              out every once in a while,</p></div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p class="justify">
              just to give your 
              body the slightest chance of repairing itself. 
              Also, remember that when going to a party, it's 
              always polite to bring something. Arriving 
              empty-handed and then eating and drinking 
              enough for six average people is very rude, a 
              fact many people, including myself, prefer to 
              remain steadfastly ignorant of.
            </p>
            <h3>4. DRESS, HAIR and SPIRITUAL SALVATION</h3> 
            <p class="justify">
              
              Jeans and anything you find at the Salvation 
              Army that's not furry or pink, is the style 
              for you as a true slacker. Haircuts are a pain,
              though. You should let your hair grow really 
              long, and then cut it all off, then start over. 
              The hard fact that hair and nails (and laundry)
              always grow is a burden to the slacker. Washing, 
              combing, conditioning, all must be done if a 
              slacker wishes to resemble anything remotely 
              human. As for spiritual salvation, the slacker 
              spirit grows even quicker than his/her hair. 
              A saved spirit grows by leaps and bounds, 
              forever empowered with the love of love itself. 
              Some slackers use psychedelic drugs in 
              combination with dancing and alcohol to 
              achieve a state of transcendental religious 
              ecstasy that keeps them spiritually saved for 
              months on end. When the buzz of God fails, 
              though, don't turn outward for guidance. 
              Within, my friends, is the only way to turn 
              for salvation! Ignore or spit on anyone 
              attempting to force their piety down your 
              throat. We are all beasts of God, and the 
              hallucinating bum on the street is a lot closer
              to grace than the self-righteous phony in the 
              pulpit. So do like Homer and stay home from 
              church. Ahhh, the Simpsons....They are the 
              true spiritual salvation of the slacker. The 
              slacker religiously watches every episode, 
              over and over, until each is memorized, 
              embodied, and quoted endlessly. Without the 
              supreme guidance of the Simpsons, the life of 
              slackers would be unlivable. Amen.            </p>
            <h3>5. IN CONCLUSION.</h3>
            <p class="justify">
              Slacking: Nobody said it wasn't going to be 
              easy. As a slacker you need to know how to 
              ignore a problem so well, it disappears on its 
              own. You need to survive for days without food 
              or water because you're too lazy to eat. You 
              need to relax so thoroughly that you pass out. 
              Are you ready for the challenge? If you are, 
              then you'll never be a slacker. Forget it. The 
              only way to make it is to not.</p>

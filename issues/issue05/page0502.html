         When asked if there was any rational reason why this was happening, the FDA official responded: "At this time, we cannot comment further. Let me just close by saying 'Eating psycho is eating... THE FUTURE!!"

We only hope that the morsels within are tasty enough to appease your lack of slack knowledge. Erich and I have been traveling the world in search of a truly sedentary culture to provide a mental futon for our underworked and overpaid minds. (Actually, we just plumb forgot to write.) 
            As a disclaimer, Erich has offered to buy any disgruntled readers a few shots of Old Williamsburg Bourbon upon request, but don't mention my name when you ask.<br>

               What goes up must come down, girls and few things re so high and fall so hard as a good solid alcohol buzz. My strategy to deal with hangovers involves first 
               treating the symptoms (Advil for headaches, marijuana for nausea, and sex if the only thing to help is to take your mind off your suffering) 
               Stretching is a good idea, too, as are Woody Allen movies, especially Stardust Memories and Play It Again Sam. I know you're not supposed to, but eating a cheeseburger

              before passing out the night before always works for me. I also find that the mental and physical pain of hangover is lessened when the drinks that 
              brought it on were free and of high quality. For the serious hangover that calls for the serious cure, try this recipe, honed in the kitchen of master chef Patty Headstrong: 
            </p>
            <h2>MINESTRONE A LA MEASY</h2>
<p class="justify">
-4 ounces salt pork rind removed<br>

            1. Cook the salt pork in a large soup pot over low heat to render the fat about 10 minutes.
             Do not let it brown. Add the butter. When it has melted add the garlic, 
            carrots, onion and leek and raise the heat slightly. Cover and wilt the vegetables for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>
           2. Add the zucchini, potato, both stocks, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and add 2 tablespoons of the parsley, oregano, basil, pepper, and salt. Simmer over medium heat for 30 minute.<br>
            3. Add the beans, tomatoes and pasta. Simmer until the pasta ts tender, 10 minutes. Adjust the seasonings and heat through. Remove salt pork. Stir in the remaining parsley and serve with Parmesan cheese alongside.<br><br>

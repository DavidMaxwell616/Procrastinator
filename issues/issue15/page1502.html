        <h2>Bake the Cake, Shoot the Bitch: A Jungian Deconstruction of Lyric in Contemporary Music <br><br>An Award winning thesis by English B.A. honoree, Abe E. Piece</h2> 
        <br>
        <p class="justify">
        Misogyny in lyrics is nothing new. In the early sixties, when Mick Jagger first sang about getting girls under his thumb, or referred to them as stupid girls, bitches who were mainly after his money and always ready to "leave him with a lethal dose", there were few aspiring young feminists who were really paying attention, obscured as the damning words were by Brian Jones' sitar, and Mick's dreamy singing. No such prettiness tends to obscure today's misogyny laden lyrics, however, especially where the Mexican Mud Band is concerned, and the offense is let out with a con-temptible, hostility-evoking sneer, the very purpose of which is often obscured. 
        <br><br>Freud once wrote that unscrupulous nurses often put children to sleep by "massaging" their genitals in a circular motion. This really has nothing to do with this essay, but isn't it interesting? And why did Freud mention this in his scandalous essay on the theory of infantile sexuality? Merely to prove his point, or to outrage and flab-bergast his stuffy Victorian audience? So then we ask , why does the Mud? 
        <br><br>Of course theologians and couch-feminists are still puzzling over the infamous alteration of the "Love Boat" lyric from "I should have shot the bitch on down" to "I should have baked the cake for the girl" (for further analysis and Dave's subsequent rationalization, please refer to Procrastinator No. 32) In a strictly Jungian interpretation, the cake represents the womb, uncooked, unbaked infertile, unleavened. The male

              provides the heat which causes the cake to rise, therefore the cake is also a phal-lus. In which case it would be the oven is the womb. Now wait. No, the oven is the womb and the unrisen cake is the phallus. Now I got it!. What about the frosting? As the French say, "The frosting we save for last" And what kind of cake? I think the woman in question would prefer any flavor (aside from coconut) to being "shot down" by the big phallus symbol gun. Note the down, which is opposite of up, hence the degradation of women. The seed that the Mud is planting in the "bitch" is the bullet, seed of death and dislike. This is the only way to get the woman "down. Perhaps down off the couch, off her pedestal, even down from her precarious perch on a rock in Central park, which has left the agoraphobic Scott stranded below, very nervous. 
              <br><br>By moving the symbolism to the kitchen, the Mud prove they have the courage most males lack. They leave their power sphere of male dominated world and enter the kitchen, the female side, and the nucleus, the hot little tub of that kitchen, the oven, the womb, which is where they lay their cake. The cake is a positive metaphor, the "laying" of the cake in the oven denotes a future wherein the cake will be presumably eaten, unless perhaps Mark made it and forgot to add the eggs. 
              <br><br>Alas, the question is moot, because the Mud didn't bake the cake at all! They lament that they should have, similar to their lament that they didn't shoot the "bitch". They are all frozen, like Narcissus in the pond, like Sleeping Beauty, they are cursed, enchanted, lacking the decisive capabilities necessary to do something. Arriving at the girl's party empty handed, they mill around i the back, nervous, hoping someone will offer them a beer, "We should've baked a cake", Scott whispers to Dave. Now they will not be asked to join in the fun of "Pin The Tail on the Donkey". Alas, if they had just entered the party with their guns ablaze, they'd have all the prizes. 
              <br><br>(Note: Abe E. Piece's essay continues for well over two hundred pages, but soon after this passage begins to wander off on unrelated tangents, including an overlong discussion of the Freudian significance behind apple pie a la mode. Unfortunately, he never arrives back at his original thesis. So for the sake of brevity, we end the discussion here.)

          <h2>Hackneyed Plotlines and Pseudo-Poignancy Can Work for You!</h2> 
          <h2>by Bruce Eezly, the Suburban Cynic</h2> 
          <p class="justify">
            In today's cinema and network sitcom/sitdram scripts, certain elements which appear to the reviewers as refreshing/original/universally appealing are actually as old as Aeschylus' Tevas. If you are embarking on a film project and you are are stuck in preproduction with an unresolved plotline, or are finding that rewrites are destroying the integrity of the characters, use these historically proven sub-plots, twists and motivation changes to flesh out your storyline. Under careful observation the scripts of Frivolous Romantic Comedies, Hospital Tearjerkers and Crime Nailbiters have only aged in terms of technological usage of props and social trends. By following some of these hints and guidelines, you too can lure the artisti-cally blind public to your wallet.<br>

              <h3>Pseudo-Poignant Revelation:</h3>  
              "I grew up in a filthy ghetto/trailer/barrio fending for myself. I watched my broth-er/sister/father/mother deteriorate from AIDS/heroin/alcohol. That's what I'm run-ning from, Dr. Kershaw."

            Some Other Key Elements: Frenetic camera jerking during emergency surgery, older, calmer General Surgeon who acts as rudder throughout plot, smattering of medical babble and hyphenations, tight, glistening entrail shots to confuse viewer's empathy with nausea, hypochondriacs, homeless people, AIDS, roof jumper, psycho with gun takes doctor hostage.<br>

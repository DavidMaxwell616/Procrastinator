   <h2>ART CHOKES IN THE CABBAGE 
  </h2>

<br>
    <p class="justify">
      In the cabbage heart, Art choked. The basest crumb of beat had stuck in its throat, and it gasped! It tore the leafed ventricle walls, and grasped, as if drowning, straws. It broke, the frail art, from that one tiny seed, that Ismail lodged life, that single beat, and the cabbage heart just pumped relentlessly on, past feeling, past dreaming, past extinction. 
      <br><br>Why did the Art have to die in this way, a pumped apart leaflet, left-ven-tricle lay in shards at its feet, in part and par-tay, the relentless and ancient apart from the day. Moving in the sought after, the high after, the ranting ravers in their Sudan evening clothes, the fashion experts all left their own designs, the plentiful ancient beforehand millions of fathering, natherings, so wise and behind the susceptible to treason who gone fleeing to bed, and raised all sorts of hopscotch in the frail tree heads, with millions of fortyish pigs in their tow, and zillions of lambsbread and basted to know if the subject was willing or bound in the night, if the peon was brain-washed on Saturday night or just left in the locker until there was light, with rhubarb he waited with rhuli-gel he faded, he itched his own scratch and thus doom was created he felt the wind lash and the blade was serrated it tore in his back and from backwards he sailed, swimming through cow pastures without a sail, just millions of fishes all tied to one tree, and millions of birdies all tied to one bee, and sang about horseradish and shredded saltines, and balloon-shaped star-chil-dren and horsefly moonbeams and all the raised lepers who in trances appeared, saying they did dream and all through the sewers that filled up with steam they saw shadows of loved ones who'd graveside went going, so many years ago, and then it was snowing and in the height of the storm what clouds did they say, they saw Urns and Thuma and Horst on TV. But Horst was a puppet, and that they didn't know much, they didn't know Bo. But Bo had contracted with Nike and Sears, and Bo had more money than 28 years, and cottage cheese reindeers sail over the walls, and everyone here is missing their balls, they should run out the front door and see what they can, they should run out for cover, and over the land to buy butter and bread for their boys overseas, and jam mar-malade for the rich folks in the streets, and in sound of a chimney pipe they shore can't run. 
      <br><br>In shores where no waves come, there's nothing gets done.

      <h2>PSEUDO-EUROPEANS ARE SEDUCING YOUR EX!</h2>
      <h3> (or "Turtlenecks In June?") by lvana Tenjin, Metro Angst Correspondent</h3> 
      They huddle around SoHo grottos with names like Amici Mei and Mezzo Giorno, emitting plumes of bluish smoke while shrugging and whipping their rigid hair our of their bronze faces. They are usually from Pennsylvania or Connecticut and led sheltered high school lives. They skipped college, moved to New York, became bitter that they had sud-denly become small fish in a big pond, and in striving for social rein-forcement and approval, they adapted European postures, accents, diets, musical taste and aggressive smugness. Now they are clerks, hostesses, floor runners and office gophers, who barely eke out a city living. Their diet consists of slivers of smoked gouda, assorted fruit wedges and iced white wine, meticulously nibbled and sipped at gallery openings. They furtively study Kurasawa, Fellini and Trouffault films every Sunday at obscure, claustrophobic film forums. Their indifferent upper-middle-class parents boost their income when needed. (Like, if they want a culinary gadget from Sharper Image.) Their apartments are sparsely decorated with low leather and glass furniture and two-color paintings. They abhor answering machines. 
      <br><br>While all of these traits are innocuous, their sex life is ravenous and unscrupulous. They change lovers (and persuasions) nightly and should be kept at arms length, for birth control is a bete noir among this twisted little cult. Condoms are detested almost as much as circumcisions. Should you come across one of these chameleons in a tavern or book bar, simply say "Non, gratzi" and head for the nearest patriot. Here are some of the telltale markings of these thinly veiled demons:

  <h2>ART'S SAKE</h2>
  <p class="justify">
    ARTISTS DIARY Take Two: This is the recently found diary of the noted artist and fraud, Erich Von Krappe. Erich, known as "Enrico" to his one fan, claims to have been born in 1904 in either Spain, France or Bulgaria depending upon his state of intoxication when he is asked by one of his many frustrated biographers. His life has been one of general upper middle class luck co-mingling with a definite inspiration derived from delusions of grandeur, and a whole persona that seems possessed by another time. Unfortunately his own laziness and general lack of talent has ensured that few if any of his few , if any, paintings are ever seen in today's art world. Nonetheless this diary, recently discovered dropped into the Sotheby's mailbox anonymously, is of interest to art historians as well as just the curious and horrified, because for all his shortcom-ings in talent, he himself, was truly a piece of work, whether he was a work of art is something for YOU to decide. We open these journals in late 1994, where Krappe (pronounced "Chre-ppejh", or some other outlandish way every different time he corrects someone for pronouncing it wrong, except when the cheer of his loyal student following, "Krappe is Art", is involved) is still laboring at the creating of "Acrylic on canvasses" a chore he will soon live up in favor of rampant egotism, loutishness and tiresome self-promotion. 
  <br><br>3/10/95 I was tremendously inspired by the view from my window this morning. I currently overlook a rather dank alley and the lack of sunshine made me so uneasy and apprehensive that suddenly it seemed necessary to do something besides sit in front of the TV, I paced around like a caged panther, fighting off the oncoming shortness of breath, cold sweat, and claustrophobic horror I knew so well. I tried doing the dishes, but the soap dries my hands so! Then I remembered that I was an artist, no a great artist, who had been languishing away. It was the artist within that I had been stifling who was signaling this panic attack! Lo, he had woken up within me by the depress-ing sight of the dingy alley! I lunged for my box of brushes and tubes of paint. I filled a cup full of water and looked for a light bulb to see by. I cleaned off a plate to use as a palette and then cut up the box my paints were in and gessoed it for a canvas. I was anxious, trembling with anticipa-tion all this while, wondering what beautiful mad vision my panic attack would create. As I waited for the gesso to dry I looked over the alley, for it was the cause, it was the very inspiration of my Muse! After 10 hours, the gesso was dry and I began to select the paints I would use. The first one I selected, yellow ochre, for its purity and sexiness, wouldn't open, neither would the second! Soon I was trying to open even the unsexiest of all paints: Burnt Umber. Even this would not open for Enrico! They were all glued shut! I tried and I tried. I held them in a tub of hot water. I pleaded with them. I danced for them. I played the drums for them, but they were glued shut. I think this is some sort of lesson. Eventually I put them all in a bag and threw them in the East River. Tomorrow I am going to a paint store. 
  <br><br>3/21/33 They had a sale on blue paint today, alas, that Picasso gets up earlier than I do, and by the time I got to the store, he had made off with the lot! At least I managed to talk that dim-witted shop-keeper down on Burnt Umber! I know I said it is unsexy, but what do I care about sexy any more? I can make anything sexy just focusing my perspective! I like it because it is good shit color; it is my life. Perhaps the school-children were right to call me "Crap" instead of "Chre-ppejh". For it pleases me to smear burnt umber on the pretty virgin white canvasses. I revel in the fact that I am a filthy creature, the shame is synergized into power! (In these next few entries, it is believed Krappe was drunk and hallucinating on whiskey, absinthe, or any number of other hallucinogens whose origins predate our current pharmacology. 
  <br><br>4/12/33 My ignorant critics go to great effort to tell me how unpleasant my burnt umber phase is to them. The fools know nothing of value. That paint was only $2.95 a tube! I still have several hundred cases to go. This is no phase by any means. This is a period! 
  <br><br>5/22/76 Somebody said it best, "Every empty canvas is a masterpiece." All I managed to do with my tal-ent and filthy brushes is to sully the nice white world. Let them that demand my paintings, them that pay high prices, let them call me "maestro" a bringer in of color to the emptiness, a giver of form, yeah. That'll teach'em. But I know, and you dear diary know, that the void is the only form, the white is often the only color and often is often enough and then we're really offed., all is white. I'll sleep a white canvas, said the timid forest. But by dawn it had sprouted greens. 3. There is no form for Enrico. There is only shape and a sketchy idea of bringing anatomical form to wind that guides my work. But the form is always lost in the wind. That is why my detrac-tors say my work has no meaning, why I need to take an evening course at the craft college. They accuse me of developing my paintings poorly. Hah! I tell them. Nuts to You! Not one of my paintings has ever been developed at all! What I have done to the poor white canvas is simulta-neously give and take away any chance at being something. One brush stroke later a master-piece is irrevocably ruined, on brush stroke earlier, it is still unfinished. During the moment in between, the phone rings. It is the grocer. He wants money."You're money is lost now, you idiot." I tell the man, "I should charge you for the canvas you just ruined." By the end of my humorous telephone harangue he is so amused he brings me up a gallon of wine and some bread. Soon he is trying to steal my wife. I whisper to her in the hall "As long as he promises a discount on but-ter." And sneak up to the loft to wreck yet another innocent piece of canvas. Oh why don't the canvas makers just see what I am doing and stop? Why do they continue making it necessary for me to devastate the face of the art world in so blaggardly a fashion? 
  <br><br>3/2/67 I am besieged by visitors even in the loft. A spider watches my work coldly from the corner and when I beg him for commentary he says nothing, merely scribbles notes in his little journal. Publish what you will you contemptible misinformed journalist! Perhaps he is just waiting for the inspiration to build his web. If he starts to spin a web I am bound to feel artistically intimidated, and I will have to crush him! Oh how I hate it love hate it love it hatove it all!

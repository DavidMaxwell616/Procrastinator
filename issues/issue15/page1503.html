  <h2>PROCRASTINATOR'S GUIDE TO DECONSTRUCTIVE VIEWING OF MTV AS A COUCH-QUARTERBACK'S MUSIC INDUSTRY, POST-WORK PIPE-DREAM... 
  </h2> 
  <p class="justify">
  
    Are you watching MTV the right way?<br>
     You should watch it as a seller, not a consumer. Understand the reality behind it, the fact that they are selling music and bubble gum to YOU. Question to yourself how effective each sales pitch is, what makes you want to buy a certain brand of perfume, or a CD? How can you learn to sell to yourself? Why give twenty dollars to Tower Records just to own vocals? How can you get other people to spend money to get your voice on record? I decided to research these interesting questions by spending a few hundred hours with Mud vocalist/guitarist Dave Parsons in front of the television watching MTV. After jotting down and forgetting some of his more vague comments, I have compiled this handy checklist, which may prove as indispensible for MTV watching as televised sports is for former athletes. Here are some handy pointers<br>

  You must bear in mind that what you buy on CD directly affects what you see. So beware, you might love Hole, for example, but if you buy their CD then in approximately six months the MTV airwaves will be flooded with woozy, obnoxious blondes. Just look at Madonna!

  <h2>LAGRECO TO RECEIVE SELF-COMMENDATION FOR FIGHT AGAINST SECOND HAND SMOKE</h2> 
<i>"The key is for smokers to never exhale" says the dizzy pundit</i><br>
<p class="justify"> 
A few patrons of the T.F.B. (Trust Fund Baby) Pub in Resin Gulch, Colorado emitted a practically audible cheer as self-appointed John Lagreco announced his candidacy for Surgeon General. Lagreco, who last year announced his candidacy for the Colorado in a moment of desperation, expects "a lot of sedatives" as a result of his inauguration. The confused and attention hungry limped up to the bar with hopes of free whiskey, a carte blanche gratuity provided to visiting VIP's in the small ski town. The Lagreco by the collar and delivered an expletive-laden diatribe, reminding him that the dishes in back were most assuredly not

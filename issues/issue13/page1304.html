      BEST VAGUE REFERENCE OF 1994<br>
      1. Gowla Gowla of the Appalachian planes made this classic vague reference over tea and bratwurst at the local moun-tain villa when a Procrastinator reporter happened to have a pen in hand: "Ganwar esperallo de montes" when translated from Swahili, means "I am weary of this meddlesome foreigner" a vague reference to the fact that he hadn't slept outside of a bed in thirty three years, a fact much discussed in the local community. 
      <br><br>2. Mr. Psyclone S. Tubbs of Tubbs and Sklowkowski was overheard to comment "There's an itch on the back of my throat," a vague reference to a sexual problem with his wife, Leopold.

      <h2>INVESTIGATORS SEIZE CONTROVERSIAL WILDLIFE FILM</h2> 
      <i>Says One Alpine Mountain Goat "I was forced to head-butt my own brother"</i>
      <br><br><p class="justify">
        Recently, a number of previously thought "wild" animals have now revealed that they are quite intelligent and have been misrepresented through deliberately choreographed violence and computer enhanced film sequences by such filmmakers as National Geographic and David Attenborough.
        <br><br>"They made us all fight, promising a lot of money." said one lion from his newly-purchased Bahama home. He confessed he made over $500,000 for his slaying of several hyenas, a crazed chimpanzee, and over four-hundred antelopes. The lion was the top-paid star of an on-going Serenghetti snuff-film operation. Many other species have also been paid off, sometimes to publicly fornicate, sometimes to fight each other over mates, often with catastrophic results. 
        <br><br>In actuality, according to sources, the wild animals tend to live relatively mundane existences. Most of their food is delivered from a local catering service and they spend their abundant leisure time by the pool, playing poker and watching sporting events. 
        <br><br>The investigation has come about by orders of the ECC, who have responded to a newly formed coalition of herbivores. This coalition (consisting mainly of antelopes and others plains herbivores) demands its members be recognized as life forms of enough sentience that eating of them is abhorrent and intolerable. Whether this effort on their part will raise sympathy or merely heighten carnivo-rous appetites, no one can say. When asked at a recent press conference whether he was worried about being called up on charges for his mass-murdering, the aforementioned lion commented that he wasn't worried, and gave a defiant thumbless thumbs-up.

   <h2> CALLED AN IDIOT</h2> 
I stood waiting for a subway,<br>
 It didn't come.<br>
  I waited for you alone.<br>
   I was called an idiot by my mom;<br>
    a hero by my idiot twin,<br>
     a leftover slice of<br> 
     pineapple pizza<br> by my girlfriend, 
     <br>when does abuse end? 
<br><br>
     Even the morning shower conspires<br>
      to hot or cold me suddenly<br>
       the soap, my enemy, leaps away,<br>
        the toothpaste slips<br>
         into the sink and I brush nothing<br>
          on empty teeth. 
<br><br>
          My humidifier's bound for<br> build-up,<br>
           I forgot to clean it<br> every night.
           <br> I'm white
           <br> with malehood 
           <br>I'm black inside but 
           <br>green with envy, 
           <br>craving credit<br> for "Stupid Pride"
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    Called an idiot <br>by myself,
     my biggest critic,<br> hoping I fail,<br>
     craving jail, <br>shy of freedom, <br>
     or pretty women. <br>"get your act together," <br>
     like a mantra <br>that doesn't work <br>
     I repeat this line <br>a thousand times, <br>
     it doesn't work.<br> "get your act together," <br>
     doesn't work. <br><br>
    Maybe I should go back to church. <br><br>
    Like an idiot, <br>he liked you first. <br>
    Like the time we went to skate <br>
    in circles inside Central Park, <br>
    the day is cold but sunny perfect,<br>
     only my feet don't hurt. <br>
     Like an idiot, could tame my monkey mind,<br>
      such glory I could carve from fate.<br><br> 
    If I could only pass the time,<br>
     instead of passing life away,<br>
      I would be fine, <br>
      'tis not the case. <br>
      I love a girl.

  <h2>I GRILLED FLESH</h2> 
  Cannibal of nature, <br>
  I consumed with relish, <br>
  things that were once living. <br>
  I grilled meat, <br>
  doused in ketchup, <br>
  barbeque sauce, <br>relish, 
  mayonnaise, <br>
  I sated ravenous hunger. 
  <br><br>God help me, I ate.<br>
   I ate it all, fish, <br>
   fowl and mammal.<br>
    I did not discriminate, <br>
    if it was dead and hot and plated, <br>
    I devoured it. <br><br>
  I confess,<br> I ate your friend, <br>
  I ate the past, <br>
  threw the evidence into the trash.<br>
   I confess,<br> I'd do it again, <br>
   I'm urged to live, <br>
   that's all I have. <br>
   God help me turn the spit<br>
    until I'm roasted.

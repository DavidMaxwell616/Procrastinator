           <p class="justify">
            1: The Pick Up:(The following tips can make the difference 
            between coming off like a Don Juan and coming off like a 
            Don Martin)
            <br><br>
            *Comb your hair - a little grooming goes a long way. 
            Avoid colognes and excessive grease. Tuck in your shirt, 
            unless your gut is going to show.
            <br><br>
            *Bring money - as much as men like big breasts, women like
            big spenders.
            <br><br>
            *Be funny, but not obnoxious. A dry wit is nearly as 
            important as dry hands. Warning: Getting laughs can inflate 
            the ego, but don't let it make you cocky or arrogant. 
            You'll never be as great as me, for example.
            <br><br>
            TWO: The Hook-Up(The following guidelines can help tilt 
            the odds in your favor from going home alone, to not 
            going home at all.)
            <br><br>
            *Be energetic - Don't yawn too much. Suggest that since 
            all the bars are closed and the night is still young, 
            why don't we get a six-pack and go back to my place. Turn 
            to your buddy and say "It's too bad you can't come with 
            us Leonard, since you have to work tomorrow," if Leonard 
            tries to remind you that he is unemployed, kick him hard 
            in the shin.
            <br><br>
            *Don't Be Too Eager - Let spontaneity be your guide,
            let the tension build as you sit next to each other on 
            the couch. When her hand is resting on your knee as she 
            rambles on about how she is still in love with her ex, 
            and just wants friendship from you, realize what these 
            contradictory signals really mean: she is saying "Kiss me, 
            but don't instantly ram your tongue down my throat. Take 
            your time, don't think ahead, anxiously rushing off to your 
            throat. Take your time, don't think ahead, anxiously rushing
            off to your orgasm as if you were running some race." And 
            after you make out for half an hour or so and she says, 
            "I think I should leave now, before I do something I regret."
            Don't say "But, baaaby!" and get all flustered and pissed 
            off. Agree with her, put your coat and slowly (very slowly)
            head for the door. If you kiss her goodbye in the right way, 
            your coat will soo be off again.
            <br><br>
            *Don't Be Too Slow - Similarly, if you wait too long, she 
            will fall asleep. To take advantage of her at this point is
            something only the most pathetic of frat boys would ever 
            consider, no matter how willing she was before. Leave her 
            a little note and take the rest of the six-pack home as your
            consolation prize.
            <br><br>
            THREE: Sex:(The following tips will help make your triumphant
            night a thing to remember, even if you forget most of it)
            <br><br>
            *Use A Condom - I know, nobody else does, but you should 
            set an example ! Though you shouldn't disrespect her for it, 
            be aware that she has probably taken other men home before 
            you, and though she picked a winner tonight, her judgment, 
            as is everyone's, infallible. And if she doesn't insist 
            you use a condom, you'll know just how bad her judgment 
            really is. It's up to you to save yourself from STDs or 
            worse, child-support.
            <br><br>
            *Don't Have an Orgasm-Make sure that she has one, if 
            possible, and then be ready to stop when she gets tired 
            or dried up. This will confuse her and make her realize 
            you are much different than the others, who cared about 
            nothing but busting their nut and getting on the first 
            subway back to Brooklyn. Of course you probably will have 
            an orgasm anyway, but try not to, you'll last longer. Plus 
            not having one reduces the chance of pregnancy, especially 
            since you won't be using a condom, even though I told you 
            to, you bastard.
            <br><br>
            *Don't be afraid to ask questions - Most girls are afraid 
            to tell you when you're doing something wrong, they just 
            grit their teeth and close their eyes like they do at the 
            gynecologists. Questions like "What do you like?" or "Does 
            that feel good?" show her that you are flexible and 
            concerned. She should be flattered and impressed. 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: Don't be scared if what she wants seems a little 
            weird, there's no limit to what you're capable of if you 
            suspend your moral judgments. Don't be a prude!
            <br><br>
            If you follow these simple guidelines, not only will your 
            one-night relationship be mutually rewarding, but you will 
            have a lot less remorse during the coming week. Who knows? 
            Maybe she'll even take you to breakfast! Either way, by 
            being safe and sympathetic, you will come off like Lancelot 
            in a sea of Louie DePalmas.

        Note: None of these procedures should be attempted without proper supervision from either a) a licensed physician, b)a defrocked member of the clergy, or c)thorazine. 
        <br><br>1. ART: If they say they don't know how to paint, remind them they had to paint in kindergarten or they got no milk. Remind them that painting is as simple as flipping a remote control, only messier. Remind them that the walls of their cell are only painted white, and that other colors do exist. Most imaginatively-challenged patients will be relieved to have a few other colors around. Brown can calm the nerves with its down-to-earthy vibrations. Red can inflame the pelvic area, causing arousal and in some cases, hysterical blindness. Avoid the use of blue, which can irritate a dullard or make him sad. Purple is a potent reminder of a lot of nasty secrets even dullards hold dear. And if all else fails, mix yellow and blue together and watch their eyes light up when they see the glory. "It's green!" they'll shout, and soon they'll have a show downtown and interest from the Saatchi Collection. 
        <br><br>2. SLEEP DEPRIVATION: Even the dullest of dullards can become interesting once they've gone without enough sleep. Try loud records scratching, biting, sudden extinguisher blasts in the dead of an ice cold winter night. After the third day, they'll say "Wow, man, I'm never gonna sleep again" and they'll THANK YOU! 
        <br><br>3. MUSIC. Try this: say to a dullard, "Hey, man, ya like music?" He'll take a sleepy hit off a hand rolled cigarette and say "Sher". Of course thr.....mtizic Leans, with the exception of Led Zeppelin, is crap. Nonetheless, you goal is to instill in him the desire to become a musician. Give him two sticks and tell him to beat them down a skin-covered can. Say "Are you following that, Leonard? Hear that? That's four/four time..." Soon your little dullard will have grown a goatee and be ready to dive into the bar-gig sea. You can sit back, ignored at the bar and say to yourself "Man, I remem-ber when that dullard couldn't play one note. I should be the famous one." 
        <br><br>4. YOU MUST PLAY THE NORMAL: In order for the dullard to now grow into his beautiful, extroverted plumage, you must pull yours in, otherwise the gaudiness of your combined coloring might make spectators nauseous. Unfortunately this means you must ease up on your astoundingly penetrative foresight and arrogant all-knowing man-ner. You must nod at the dullard and say "You know, Leonard, I never thought of that before." when he espouses to you his philosophy and trenchant observations. As his bag gets windier, he may emulate you and adopt your same cocky walk or snide phrasing, and alas, you must let him. Better he should learn from a pro than foolishly adopt the poise of, say, an non-existent person. 
        <br><br>5. SEX: Either your dullard knows too much about this topic or not enough, and we prefer he know not enough. Sex is alas, the great pretender to the throne of truly erotic behavior, namely the erotic act of artistic creation. Even the mighti-est of artist have thrown the brush and palette aside in order to set themselves hungrily upon a defenseless, destitute, utterly naked model. After which, the "great" artist seldom continues painting, preferring instead to smoke furiously and move to the window, look out over the sea, utterly full of himself and his loathsome French ways. Meanwhile, he is denying mankind the beauty and perfection he SHOULD have created upon the canvas. And what of his frail, ruined model? As the French say"Zat eez anuzzer story". She stares up at the ceiling and thinks only of mocha-mint ice cream... 
        <br><br>6. HORMONAL IMBALANCES:Seldom has a topic as grave as this been dealt with half as seriously as we'd like to. Unfortunately, a strict censor and a short-attention span make it all but impossible. If we were to draw the dullard a dia-gram, it would show the "X-Zone" which secretes serotonin and dopas, and we would say "Alas, dear Leonard, God for-got to give you an X-Zone." No X-Zone means no archaic symbols cropping in your hallucinations, no X-Zone means no mind-bogglingly intricate dreams that wake you up in the middle of the night, bathed in sweat, nerves tingling, feel-ing utterly alive and hurtling through space, rooted to the magnificent world like a tree, only deeper than tree roots can . • .. . dig, and ye. holding a soul that determined to escape into the heavens, to a greater fate than death,' or birth, or future. And no X-Zone means no visualization of inner struggles between good and evil, between human animal inexactitude And _ visualization _ and the urge to transcend exactitude itself. No X-Zone means no ability to use a word like "exactitude" even if you're pretty sure you don't know what it means. 
        <br><br>7. CHEST PAINS: Like all of us, dullards too suffer from chest pains, the result of a bland diet and partly through too much health, any dullard is likely to complain about one of these awful regularities of late-twenties life and when they do, you will be poised to deliver a Zen style blow of true enlightenment "Do you want me to fix your chest for you?" You ask, and then whack them squarely on the back, between the shoulders. If the Buddha is smiling on you, you may just shift them into a state of higher consciousness. If you do not achieve this, admittedly hard-to-attain result, move your now not-a-dullard out of the restaurant and back to your apartment. There with dim candles and magic healing drums, explain to him the journey of the four horsemen and of the rebirth of Eros, and of the two serpents (facing each other, but they are one) and of the squirrel that saw its own shadow and thought it was a groundhog. Then rub your patient vigorously with a strong herb and beat him into a coma. 
        <br><br>8. EDUCATION: If none of these handy, easy to use methods are successful, you will just have to throw your dullard back into the sea and pull out a new one. Remember, some dullards do become interesting on their own, so perhaps a library card or a shot of B-12 might be just the thing to loosen that stuck pencil. A very broke poet once said, "Put a monkey in a room with paints and a canvas. If he doesn't break the stretcher before you get it back, you'll have a work of art. Put a dullard in a room with paints and a canvas and if he makes a work of art, he'll be driven to break the 
        stretcher of paint over it before he gives it back." What he meant by this is vague even to this day, but scholars from the questionably titled "School For The Moronically Enabled" have theorized - and thus based the academia's main principle upon them for the taking. The possibilities are so overwhelming that they dwarf our own, limited human 
        imaginations. The dullard, upon getting a look at all this sophisticated paraphernalia he could have been using to rule the world, could have been king, a contender at least, all this stuff covered in dust because he was so sure he knew all the rooms in his house, 
        prefers to shut the door and go down and get a beer and sit in the nice well-lit kitchen and eat himself into a stupor. That is fine, but as you put your coat on and head off into the night, be sure and leave a pamphlet on your way out: 
        "I Know You're Not As Dull As You Really Are." by Abe E. Piece, or Kandosky's classical treatise "Not So Bright, But Still A Star."

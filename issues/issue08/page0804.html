        <h2>DOKTOR TWILITE COUNSELS THE LOVELORN</h2> 
X-Bro Twilite is a licensed practitioner of Haziness and Ineptitude and 
teaches seminars all over the country without ever leaving the side of 
his TV. Occasionally he provides desperate readers with a clue to their
own belligerence, he does this with moments of pristine clarity and 
absolute disregard for coherence.<br><br> 
<h3>BEWILDERED BY BAD VIBES</h3> 
Dear Doktor,<br> 
Stupidly, I graduated college in only 4 years. With so much partying left 
undone, I avoided career choices and escaped to Seattle to 
become a gunge rocker. Well, I managed to meet one, and he managed
to steal my girlfriend. In despair. I eagerly boomeranged back 
home to New Jersey where I still live, with my folks. My younger 
brother's all moved out and got girlfriends, money and cool apartments. 
I work part-time as a temp for a local pharmaceutical corporation, 
cleaning out the animal cages, disposing of the corpses. Needless to 
say, the smell of death is on me and the women know to keep away. 
How can I escape to New York, get a cool apartment and a patient 
girlfriend, one with bad judgment and a financially secure future.<br>

          Consider the lillies of the field. They toil not, and neither are they 
          mowed. Nothing compels you to walk, and you walk not, knowing you
          are on the path to success. Stop. Rest. Your current path is beat. Eat
          at more expensive Chinese Restaurants. Consider the flesh you consume, the 
          cages it has slept in, the lonely nights it's wept in. The misery that
          you devour can be redeemed to transcending love! Free the 
          pigs! The pigs can swim! Freedom rings! The Pigs can win! The
          Peace Pig sings! He sings as he drinks the blood of decent farming men.
          He drinks with love and that's the way we never could drink him. Think about it.

          <h3>TOO MANY LOSERS</h3> 
          <p class="justify">
            Dear Doktor,<br>
             Why is it that all the attractive single men in New York don't want a 
             girlfriend? Are they so suffused with their own sense of self worth that 
             they no longer require a woman? Have they become, in some perverse 
             way, their own women (I'm talking about hetaosexuals)? If so, why? 
             And what can be done about it?<br> 
            - Curiously Under No Therapy<br><br> 
            Find a man who can only be attractive when he's around you and he'll 
            be yours forever. Attractive men get enough favorable attention from
            ALL the women they meet that they don't need anyone. Ugly men get 
            NO favorable attention from women, and need a girlfriend so desperately, 
            they become uglier. Find a man who is in between and teach him decent 
            grooming habits. Shine him up, and teach him to unclench his jaw. 
            Over time the swelling will die down and he won't be too bad. 
            For your effort, you'll have a devoted boyfriend who is scared he'll 
            be ugly without you.

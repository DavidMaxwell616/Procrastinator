        Note: This list may seem arbitrary and you probably think that other movies, like 
        "Where The Day Takes You", "Four Friends" or "Stand By Me" should qualify, and yet 
        your collection is so meager.

<h2 class="sans">MAX'S TOP 10 PUKE SCENES IN MOVIES</h2> 
<div class="col-sm-6">

<p class="justify">
It could be that vomiting represents the pinnacle of entertainment in America.
How many incredible party stories do you know that climax with a tremendous vomitus?
Not only is vomit the ultimate party favor, but also the single-most powerful body function
legally portrayable on mainstream screen (so far). Puke scenes usually occur when people are drunk,
have seen/smelled a dead body, are possessed, have eaten too much, or are emotionally distraught.
The following are some choice selections I think you may enjoy. I disqualified all characters who made it to a toilet.
That's cheating. You may even wish to watch these movies and join your favorite stars as they purge on camera. Simply
start drinking whiskey funnels an hour before the movie starts, averaging one every 10 minutes. It works for me!
<br><br>
The rating system is as follows:<br>
VOLUME - The physical amount seen leaving the star's mouth.<br>
COVERAGE - The spew radius. Bonus stars for people hit<br>
REALISM - Does the person look ill enough? Convulsive?<br>
FACIAL DISTORTION - Are the muscles slack? Strained?<br>
VISCOSITY - Does the spewage resemble stringy bile or lumpy backstage tapioca?<br>
SOUND EFFECTS - Very important. Must be gutteral.<br><br>

2. Veronica Cartright from "The Witches of Eastwick." Although the movie's plot careens wildly from romance to horror to black comedy, 
Cartrights vomit is phenomenal. It is difficult to make a power boot realistic from a frontal camera angle, but this one cuts the mustard with cherries on top.<br>

4. C Thomas Howell from "The Hitcher". I first watched this movie with Syracuse Whiskey Guru Jason Rosenberg, and we found the scene in which C. Thomas finds 
the slaughtered family in the station wagon so compelling that we continually rewound the retch for a full half hour. The volume produced is low, as is the coverage, but C. Thomas' face is hysterical.<br>

        <h2 class="sans">ARTSCENE</h2>
        by Jacques Knight-Angleterre<br><br>
        Asterisks mark the especially hip scenes (*) and hip(d) marks the especially risky scenes. All reviews are subject to re-interpretation.<br><br> 
<b>DOWNTOWN:</b><br>
If you walk just a little ways past the quaint new <u>Old, Unquaint Gallery</u> (33 W. Houston) with its current exhibit of Pre-Post-Pre-Post-Postmodernism works 
of Jacques Johnson you'll find, right on the corner of Houston and West Broadway, a most interesting exhibit. The exhibit is, apparently, the leftover cast offs of 
a recent work by <b>Con-Edison</b>. The scene is of a broken barricade, a small oil slick, two discarded pizza boxes, a smashed pylon and some warning flags lying in a rain puddle. 
The obvious intent of this small masterpiece of found object d'art is to pose the question of negative/post-positive viewpoint. Is the passerby a victim or a victimizer of this scene? 
It calls into question the concept of electricity. The viewer is made cognizant of his/her own powerlessness over power, or whether one's own power isn't out at home. 
What do they mean, these thrown away relics of the courageous blue-collar men who give us current. While most pedestrians pay scarcely a second glance to the forgotten, 
yet conspicuous and inconveniently located site, true art fans are floored by the seemingly effortless array of garbage and forgotten public utility equipment. 
Most of all, there is the tragedy of its temporality. You feel in these fallen beams and snippets of wire the very frailty of electric power. It reminds us all that we are 
just conduits of some massive force, that God is a Con-Edison worker who has left us behind, like a discarded chunk of cable, and moved on to service other trouble spots 
(Front of Ezio's Pizza, 335 West Broadway. Exhibit will be shown until the cleaning crew arrives - ***) <br><br>
<b>EAST VILLAGE:</b><br> 
In a small head shop on eighth street, there is a very interesting selection of teenage rock and roll wares, cleverly arranged, under a long glass display case that is worth the 
trip for any art fan too tired to swim up past 50th. Next to 
      </div>    
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        Dead-insignia-ed butane lighters are a colorful selection of bandanas and hash pipes. The juxtaposition is obviously a taunting reminder of the hazy neo-hippy cubism-cum-pharmacy deliria of the late, great <b>Howdy Dew D'e</b>. The very transitory nature 
        of the rock-n-roll supply world rings out, as it did so well in Dew D'e's famous sculpture, <u>I Gave My Love A Cherry Pit</u>. The exhibit is in the heart of Jersey high school 
        punk stoner wannabe hell.. It reminds the Manhattan art-head of the lower masses need for heroes. The newly legendary <b>Kurt Cobain</b> now joins the ranks of rock's great drug users, 
        his face on bandannas and biker patches now next to Led Zeppelin, Elvis and Jesus, and on and on, until you get to the water pipes...(Mohammed's Novelties, 334 E 8th Street - ***)<br><br> 
        <b>POST-NO BILLS WOODEN BARRICADE,</b><br> 
        2nd Avenue and 50th. In a row of plastered-on new <b>Kate Moss Calvin Klein Ads</b>, which reveal behind her creamy Goddessette figure a crew of scruffy looking bald rappers named <b>Onyx</b>. 
        The juxtaposition of pristine, impossibly thin white girl perfection and angry black youths photographed in grainy, gaudy color is as powerful a piece of street noise as <b>Ubu Art Bamoque</b> 
        ever dreamed of back in his day as graffiti-terrorist street guru of the <b>Back to Back and Back Again</b> movement that flourished briefly during a hot evening in 1992. 
        Are the black rappers in Onyx angry because white Kate has covered them? Or are they angry because part of her has been ripped away, maybe their favorite part? Maybe they were happy under Kate, 
        protected from the elements and soot of New York and all of its grime and pestilence. Certainly all but the most weight and race conscious are happier drooling over Kate's soothing eyes and supple 
        limbs than looking at yet another gang of butt-ugly black brawlers. What makes this damaged poster layer-cake into art is knowing that behind Kate's bikini lurks a horde of angry black fists. 
        You can almost imagine their anger giving her strength, their upraised arms carrying her slim white innocence aloft. Venus walking over the Black Sea. See it now before they plaster over something else, 
        like Kenny G with his anemic grin or worse...(vacant lot, West Side of 2nd Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets. - ****)

      <h2 class="double">ANGRY MUD SCORNS PROCRASTINATOR FOR IGNORING THEM</h2>
      The Mexican Mud (whose official newsletter this is, though you probably couldn't tell from the conntent) have made veiled threats to the PROCRASTINATOR staff that if they don't start doing more articles relating to the band 
      as opposed to articles about the personal lives of the PROCRASTNATOR staff, they will withdraw sponsorship. We here at the PROCRASTINATOR have tried our best but can find very little of interest to write about the Mud men. 
      Should we attempt typical "fan-club" style articles - "My Dream Date With Don", or "Life With Dave Parsons"? Let me tell you girls, life with Dave Parsons isn't as glamorous as you may think. Or "What Are Scott's Favorite Things To Do With His Hands?" 
      Do you really want to know? As readers of the PROCRASTINATOR, you have to tell us what YOU want to know about the Mud because WE already know them, and WE would rather write about something else.<br><br>

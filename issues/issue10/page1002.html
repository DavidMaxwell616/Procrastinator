        <h1>You Suck!</h1>
        <p class="justify">Don't get mad at me when I tell you this. It's the truth! We all suck, whether through a straw, or on a lozenge, 
          or down an ice cold beer. There is nothing wrong with "sucking" in this manner, and yet the word sucking is such a negative one, 
          popularized to a ridiculous extreme by Beavis and Butthead, that a young person is bound to be besieged by self-doubt when embarking 
          upon a round of "sucking". After all, no one sucks more than babies, on a pacifier or bottle or nipple, and surely they are not to 
          be shunned or ridiculed for this?! <br><br>
        The worst is that with Beavis and Butthead's popularity, the square older marketers of the world are adopting the negative connotation 
        of "suck" to relate to the world's youth. "Suck" Is used everywhere as a catch phrase to help tap into their baby wallets. A typical 
        commercial might read "Try our gum, the one that doesn't suck" or, "School sure sucks, but not when you're on a sugar high like the one 
        you get from Slug Bar!" Why is sucking such a stigma?<br><br> 
        Of course, we all know it is the orally sexual connotation of the world that makes it so despicable. Yet, wouldn't it seem a little 
        stupid of Beavis and Butthead, two pathetic virgins, to shun this act with such cavalier brazenness? Sucking is associated with a 
        sexual act that is very specialized among humans. It Is done to men by their lovers and it causes them great ecstasy, and yet, there 
        is no reward, no lofty position granted to the generous lover who performs this sucking action. In fact, "Yo, suck my d----" is 
        considered an incredible insult. Shouldn't it serve as the impassioned request of a loved one? I am sure there is nothing any self-respecting 
        hedonist male would like more than to have this action performed on them, and yet they stigmatize the word In layer upon layer of insidiously 
        vile adolescent significance.<br><br> 
        So, let's get together and think about sucking in a more positive light, boys and girls. And the next time someone tells you that you suck, 
        smile and say "Thank you. Not only that, but I suck with intensity!"</p>

        <h1>MAN IN CLEVELAND REVEALS LACK OF INTEREST IN OJ CASE</h1> 
        <p class="justify"></p>His neighbors little suspected. His wife, who watched Court TV avidly, had no clue. Then, last night, Edward Pinque dropped his paper in 
        his lap, finished his third Manhattan and defiantly declared that he had no interest whatsoever in the OJ Simpson case. "I still can't believe 
        this is true," his wife said in a sob-ridden statement to the press. "He always seemed interested, even during the second hour of that Bronco 
        police chase."<br><br> 
        The national press is trying to discredit Mr. Pinque, calling him everything from "hopelessly jaded by an overwhelming amount of media stimuli" 
        to "moron" in the desperate hopes that nobody in America will realize that somebody else shares their lack of fascination with what is bing called 
        the murder trial of the century. Mr. Pinque, when asked to comment on what sort of backlash his apathetic stance might create, could only spit, 
        shrug and admit that he didn't care about that either. Good going, Pinque!

          <h3>Procrastinator's Garth Flurrybush reports:</h3>
        <h1>GUIDE TO FALL FASHION, 1994</h1>   
        <p class="justify">
          Of course by now everyone in the fashion world is livid over Anthony Spaglioni's plan to unveil a new line of sleeved sleeveless flannel shirts,
          part of his gigantic "Dumb Beaux" line that will feature surface pattern design only on the inside of the garment. "Completely invisible to the naked eye," 
          Spaglioni hinted to me during an especially perfumy summer yachting accident. "You have to turn them inside out to see the patterns. On the outside, they look.." 
          he paused for a heightened sense of fopperic drama, "...like crap." Already there is a fervent bidding war over Spaglioni's new line. Apparently many other top 
          designers are concerned that the fine is so awful that it might in fact end the world of high fashion as we know it, creat-ing a sort of apocalypse of haute couture, 
          so there is a furious furor to buy Spaglioni out and make sure the clothes never reach the states.<br><br> 
          "This line of clothing is so embarrassing and awful," commented fashion scholar Eunice Malklegh, "that it can't he but catch on among the young Americans here." Grunge is the 
          height of twenties Parisian fashion compared with Mr. Spaglionl's so called "Dumb-Beaux" line.

<h1>SLACKER'S GUIDE TO CHEAP FALL VIDEO BUYS </h1>
<p class="justify">
  Procrastinating without a videotape library is almost a complete waste of time. To just aimlessly channel surf off cable is stupefying, and a good procrastinator doesn't need to be any 
  stupider. Therefore a large personal library of tapes is necessary so that the next late-night vkleofest you run can remain free of the "psychic-home-network" or "Nightllne". If you go 
  and try to buy a pre-recorded videotape, they can be expensive. You can make your own tapes off cable, but who can remember when the movies are on? Unless you have two VCRs, it's impossible 
  to tape tapes (even with two, copyguards are everywhere). For some of us hardcore slackers, this Is just too much damn effort. The following is a Ilst of some great movies that you are likely 
  to find in the "bargain bin" of any major chain, I.e.: Tower, Wiz, etc. shuffled amidst the "Golfer's Weakest Practical Bloopers Vol VII," and 'Monster Truck Expo Meets the Shao-Un Destroyer" 
  for about $1 to $4.99 each.<br><br> 
1. Carnival of Souls (Average retail: $5) 1962, Dir. Herk Harvey: An eerie black and white masterpiece about a non-religious church organist who finds her-self caught between life and death, 
stuck in the relentlessly empty world of middle America woman, haunted by nightmares that bleed Into daily life. The lead, Candice Hikfigloss, gives a classic performance, but the main credits 
belong to the cast of characters that surround her as she tries to adjust to life, the demon pursuing her seems showy and normal in comparison to their genuine normality which is the creepiest 
thing in the film. An absolute must-own at the price.<br><br> 
2. Joe (available now at the bargain rack by your local Wiz cashier: $3.99) 1970 Peter Boyle (In a pre-"Young Frankenstein" role) is a lower-class hippie-hating bigot who befriends an upper-class 
hippie-killer (who murdered his daughter's drug-dealing beaux) The two demented dads go "undercover and wind up in bed with two free-lovin' women, but when these drugged-out wantons reveal they 
prefer their snotty young moocher male companions for the long-term, they get mad and start shooting. This Is a movie you'll want to show again and again to your friends. <br><br>
3. Creature from the Haunted Sea (Average retail: $5) and The Little Shop of Horrors, (Dir. Roger Gorman) In this period of the fifties, schlock-master Roger Corman was adopt-ing a sort of a 
like "beatnik" feel to his horror movies In order to hit two markets at once for the then thriving drive-ins of middle America as well as the hipper "grindhouses" of Times Square. Murder and crazy 
existential dialogue flow throughout both, "it's like hep, man."

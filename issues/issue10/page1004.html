        <h2>WAR OF THE WORLDS WON!<br>PREZ SEZ "UFO'S ARE AMONG US!"</h2>  
          <p class="justify">The government officially admitted to a coverup 
            today, one spanning over 40 years and involving cattle mutilations, 
            crop circles, UFOs and, embarrassingly enough, Elvis sightings. 
            The president revealed in a short speech to an stunned press 
            that the top levels of the US government have been taking drastic ]
            measures to keep alien visitation a secret, employing such underhanded 
            means as discrediting witnesses, confiscating extra-terrestrial evidence 
            and dancing around making loud donkey noises to distract attention. 
            "Until now, policy has been to keep Joe Average American a tranquil and 
            assured consumer, free to watch banal TV, indulge in delusions of grandeur 
            and consume conspicuous amounts of beef and milk products," the president 
            said, "I'm here to say, Mr. Joe Average American, those salad days are done. 
            Dinner is served!" The president then went on to announce that the government
            will work to educate the people by signing a deal with Amco Entertainment and 
            HBO to produce a startlingly long mini-series dealing with the 40-year 
            conspiracy. It will be called "Plan Ten" and star Parker Louis Stevenson, 
            Elke Sommer and Don Knotts. Rumor has it that Mr. T has been approached 
            about playing the Reverend Al Sharpton, (who although in no way involved 
            in the cover-up, is insisting he be included). 
            <h3>ALIENS LAUNCH "STAR" INTO AMERICAN HOMES! </h3><br>
            <p class="justify">   Among the scheduled highlights of the mini-series will be "Enis", an EBE (Extraterrestrial Biologic Entity is the government's term for our little green visitors) who is apparently the hottest thing going in the rest of the TV watching galaxy. Enis is currently making plans to visit Earth as the first official "superstar" from another world. "Mork, My Favorite Martian, E.T., they are all so meager! Now you have me, Enis! You will buy many products with my face on them, and will look foolish no more!"
               Enis will be the first alien super-popstar who is at the same time not a transvestite. Enis resembles if anything a cross between the creature in Close Encounters (whose director he is planning to sue for royalties in the near future) and a pint-sized New York real estate broker.<br><br> 
              "On my planet, we have no water," lamented Enis at a press conference to announce the series. "You will see just how thirsty I am during the premiere. 
              I must drink several times a year. And I cannot urinate, for we aliens do not have pissing tools, obviously since on our planet there is no water." 
              Even after explaining this phenomenon several times, few scientists would believe him. Many noteworthy scientist are still unwilling to believe in 
              the aliens at all, including renowned sky-watcher Karl Sagan who feels there is no evidence beyond what our five senses can grasp to indicate they actually 
              exist. The truth will be coming soon, as Enis already has plans to "bare" all, as we'll soon discover when, this November, when he will pose nude for a spread 
              in the American Journal of Science.

                <h1>MEXICAN MUD ALMOST BURNS TO DEATH IN SYRACUSE FIRE</h1> 
                <i>East L.A., Syracuse NY</i><br>
                 Enrico Suave reports: Thousands were packed into a sweaty horde of nervousness, soon to be denied what they had dreamt of from the start, what?<br> 
                Let's try that again...<br> 
                <h1>MUD MEMBERS CHARGED WITH OBNOXIOUSNESS, LEWDITY, DISTURBANCE...</h1> 
                <i>Oswego, New York</i><br>
                 Ericho Guave reports: Scott "the Musician" Lehr and Don "Knotts" Martin were recently sentenced to over four hours weak labor last Saturday when, 
                 following a raucous out-of-town gig, they were discovered during a routine police frisk to be carrying well over $5 in mini-soaps and shampoos stolen 
                 from a Quality Inn, from which they had recently checked out. A frightened maid soon stepped forward to charge them with smart alecky comments, 
                 pseudo-Marx-Brotherish antics and atrocious grooming habits. Also implicated, though still at large, is the notorious Dave "The Instigator" Parsons, 
                 who apparently ordered a single room at the hotel, knowing full well that over 40 people were planning on sleeping there. "I ask him how many people," 
                 said Achmed Amann, the night-clerk, "and he said 'one' meaning him. Then I walk past room, there is laughter, many people laughing, door opens, I look in. 
                 I realize he lie! This Dave Smith, he a liar! Not one people like he say! So many people, on floor, on bed, and toilet paper...people and toilet paper everywhere!" 
               <br><br>
                Apparently the Mud were playing "toilet-paper baseball," a game where toilet paper rolls are substituted for balls, a lamp often serves as a bat, and the bases are "anywhere broken glass isn't." Since a storage closet had been left open down the hall, there was no shortage of balls, and within hours the room was thigh-deep in tissue. When asked who won, a young woman who was at the scene could only guess, "I think the loud, drunken fat guy won." 
                Don "the Dean of Mean" Martin, due to his parents being in closest proximity, was the first to be freed on the $20 bail, immediately he was re-arrested for lewdness. Apparently, Mr. Martin exited the holding tank "hanging brain",
                 a crime against good-taste which carries a very stiff penalty in the colder towns of upstate New York. The courageous dangler commented later that he was unrepentant 
                 over his small deed; admitting he was, in fact, looking forward to some quality jail time, since he now has a roommate to watch his dog back home in NYC. He currently faces 
                 well over three hours in cengresstonai red tape. So with Don cheerfully awaiting life imprisonment, Scott still anxiously hoping for his dad's promised fed-exed check, and 
                 P.P. Parsons still at large, hunted and despised, we are left with only Mark "Shangley Man" Czuj and Matt "Own" Pedone free from charges, we can only wonder how this courageous 
                 band will get home in time for the new Simpsons.

            and the furious this morning, as The Mexican Mud Band held a press conference to apologise for luring 
            mudheads across the nation into divulging their favorite Chinese foodstuffs. Howls of disapproval and 
            outrage greeted them as they took the platform and began cockily dissembling the equipment. Scott Lehr 
            blearily denied charges that the band was attempting to sell the results and admitted with regret that 
            they believed El Della Rucho was attempting to 'fix' the poll, somehow, for whatever reason of his own. 
            The crowd disbanded dazedly after the Mud launched an improvisatory a capella rap that threatened to last long into the night.

    discovered what he thought to be the essence of "soul" in a jar of Skippy Peanut Butter last Friday. Authorities 
    presumed the claims to be a hoax at first, but they soon discovered what they described as an unmistakably "funky" smell
  emitting from the jar in question. Placed under observation, Mr. Mantooth. who refers to be called "Rooty", was able to rasp

              I am a genetic major with a philosophy minor. Naturally you can understand my ethical dilemna. In addition, as if life wasn't difficult enough, I'm a quasi-sexual burdened with an X-dimensional spouse that only appears in dreams, memories and hallucinations. Drugs aren't solving the problem anymore. I am compelled to seek employment. Can you recommend an alternative?

            Dear Doctor Twilight,<br>
            As confused as your works have been in the past, nothing comes close to the mess you made of the "Slackers Guide to Life"(Vol. I). What you describe is not life so much as lack of life. 
            What kind of goal is it to have no goal at all?

         Is this really the beginning of the motionless movement, or are you merely rationalizing your inertia! You strike me as being trapped in a Dionysian mindset yet your philosophy lacks sacrifice, suffering and mutilation so essential to such a frame of existance. 
         It's like having a highball without the whiskey. I'd stick to writing cover letters if I were you.<br>

<p class="justify">            
  Dear Mrs. Thurmann,<br>
   First of all, there's plenty of mutilation and death involved in the slacker lifestyle. It's all done to the mind and internal organs through prolonged excessive consumption of various benign poisons. The body is ritually sacrificed (i.e. impending hangover) so that the mind may be freed from its prison - if only for a night of Bacchnalistic reverie. 
   I'd like to take this chance to flaunt the fact that you gave me an A for a paper that I plagiarized, and also ask you for a recommendation.<br>
    -Sincerely,<br>

              In a little log dorm in the Syracuse Arctic, the anguished cries of a newborn baby band are heard. Soon the distraught, alcohol-adddled parents hear a knock at the door-BOOM! BOOM! A heartless Resident Advisor bursts in and complains that the baby is too loud. The RA, with a cruel glint in her eye, threatens to 'write" the parents up if they don't smother the child or at least move it down to the basement linen closet. Being high slackers, the parents almost consider the former option, but compassion prevails and the newborn family begins its long, torturous journey from the soft, smoky decadence of the seventh floor to the dank. cold starkness of the linen closet. There, as fate would have it, the baby can actually be heard by more people, as its caterwalling echoes up the 22 story elevator shaft of Lawrinson Hall. Looks of fear

              and panic cross the formerly complacent college student elevator passengers. The baby had begun to speak. <br>
              This was back before funk had re-ignited the stove of music, back when the general populace was numbed by mid-80's Top 40 with its regurgitated pablum and plywood complexity-The young band was forced to wean itself on the damp mulch and cold gruel of the Dylanesque 60's. Knowing few chords, fewer beats and saddled with any drifting "musicians" available, the young Mud wailed and screeched its blues away, straining to be heard through shitty amps and broken drums. As It creeped along in its grotesquely disfigured, but well-intentioned state, no one would have guessed that such chaotic squalor would eventually evolve into such a fierce, adamant and complex creature as the TRUE MUD!!

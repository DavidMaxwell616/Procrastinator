          and the furious this morning, as The Mexican Mud Band held a press conference to apologise for luring 
          mudheads across the nation into divulging their favorite Chinese foodstuffs. Howls of disapproval and 
          outrage greeted them as they took the platform and began cockily dissembling the equipment. Scott Lehr 
          blearily denied charges that the band was attempting to sell the results and admitted with regret that 
          they believed El Della Rucho was attempting to 'fix' the poll, somehow, for whatever reason of his own. 
          The crowd disbanded dazedly after the Mud launched an improvisatory a capella rap that

         discovered what he thought to be the essence of "soul" in a jar of Skippy Peanut Butter last Friday. Authorities 
         presumed the claims to be a hoax at first, but they soon discovered what they described as an unmistakably "funky" smell
        emitting from the jar in question. Placed under observation, Mr. Mantooth. who refers to be called "Rooty", was able to rasp 
        all the words of James Brown's anthem "I'm

    <P class="justify">In a little log dorm in the Syracuse Arctic, the anguished cries of a newborn baby band are heard. Soon the distraught, aleoholoddled parents hear a knock at the door-BOOM! BOOM! A heartless Resident Muster bums in and complains that the baby is too loud. The RA., with a cruel glint in her eye, threatens to 'write" the parents up if they don't smother the child or at least move It down to the basement linen closet. Being high slackers. the parents almost consider the former option, but compassion prevails and the newborn family begins In long. toiturous journey from the soft, smoky decadence of the seventh floor to the dank. cold starkness of the linen closet. There, as fate would have it, the baby can actually be hoard by mum people, as la eatenvalling echoes up the 22 story elevator shaft of Lawrinson Hall. Looks of fear and panic cross the

Knowing few thonds, fewer beats and saddled with any drifting 'musicians" available, the young Mud waded and screeched its blues away, straining to be heard through shitty amps and broken drums. As It escaped along In Ids grotesquely disfigured, but well-intentioned state, no one would have guested that such chaotic squalor would eventually evolve Into such a fierce, adanum and complex creature as the TRUE MUD!!

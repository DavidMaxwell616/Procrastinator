  <p><i><u>Some sound advice from an unsound mind.</u></i></p>
  <hr class="double">

<P class="justfy">Remember that drinks, especially in New York City, are expensive. Always get drunk before you get to the bar - especially in NYC when you don't have to (and shouldn't) drive to and from the gigs. When the Mud starts playing, your buzz should be in high gear. You shouldn't be just 
  standing there, all straight, sipping your first beer of the night- especially if it's $5 a beer. With proper pacing you too can go for distance. Think about it and bring a flask! -and some foe me too! -MWSM

      <h1>DANCERS MISINTERPRET "STUMBLE" LYRICS - MELEE ENSUES</h1>

<div class="col-sm-4">
  <p class="justify">Thousands of weirdos collided into innocent bystanders, spilling their beers, extinguishing cigarettes and sweating on them, while attempting to interpret the message of the Mud song Mx Educated Stumble'. The song entreats the listener to stagger, sway and lurch about, but achieving a transcendence of coordination by never actually becoming reckless. The concept is to almost, bus never quite fall on or bang into anyone (unless they are your friends and dancing, too). Please try to enjoy the song without bun casualties and eat a big meal so you'll have plenty to puke at the end. The Mud could be reached for comment, but the editors chose to ignore them.

    <h1>THE ORIGINS OF THE MUD</h1>

<div class="row">
 <div class="col-sm-4">
    <P class="justify">Now it can be told, the strange saga of lust, greed, betrayal and death. A story too bold, too powerful, to telL..until now. Now, at last it can be told. Formed in a repressive Syracuse dorm, soon the horrible backlash of freedom would tear their young lives apart. See Jackie Chan as Dave Parsons. He started our a starry-eyed innocent Deadhead and wound up ruling an immense dynasty of power using nothing but two strong hands and a head as hard as stone. See Troy McClure as Don Martin, a hustler, a dealer in everything from cool tie-dyes to ambitious credibility, determined to pay his rent...at any cost. With Yngve Malmsteen as Mark Czuj, the wily Pole with the heart of gold and fingers of unbridled fury.

    <P class="justify">Tom Jones stars as Matt Pedone. He lived the high life - fast boats, fast cars, homes on Long Island and Florida. He had it all, and he put it all on the line....for love. Special guest Robin Williams as Scott Lehr. Before she came into his life, he was just a wiseass. Soon he became a wiseass with a great girlfriend. See it all, read the horrorful story of the past, of the strange goings on in a college that by day spawned learning but at night spawned depravity, violence...outrageous, passioned orgies of alcohol and fleshy sins! Sex was their goal, drugs their obsession, rock and roll their very life!

      <h2><u>Beer Hustling in the Big City</u></h2>
      <br><h3>By Tracy Measy</h3><br>
  <p class="justify">With relations between men and women in a wild state of flux, 
    and with the PC-ers suggesting that to open the door for a woman is demeaning 
    and sexist, it's high time for a practical exploration into the Politics of 
    Free Beer. Since the last time the editors were on either end of a free beer 
    was back in the days of the pop-top, they asked me to go undercover for one weekend, 
    to explore the soft underbelly of this hard-boiled city, the bar. The place 
    where mere acquaintances spill their whole sordid life stories 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3">
    <p class="justify">to each other, and where a total stranger will offer to buy you a drink...if you play 
      your cards right. While it does happen that women spontaneously buy men drinks, this rare cutgence is difficult to document, and plays almost no part in this story. I cannot, in these pages intended for general consumption, relay the bizarre sequence of events that was to unfold Â°set that drunken weekend. but I have distilled my experience into some practical tips on hustling beer. As is often the case with us, your appearance may have more bearing on your success than your state of mind but, here are some guidelines for the young and the thirsty.<br>
      1.) You should appear to be, if not alone, somewhat independent from your group of friends (I don't recommend trying this without some backup unless you really know 
    </p>
</div>  
<div class="col-sm-3">
  <p class="justify">what you're doing). Standing alone or appearing bored and actively scanning the room while standing with your friends works well. Men are afraid to approach whole groups They'd rather single you out horn the pack.<br>
    2.) Smile, look at least semi-alert. This makes you more approachable.<br>
    3.) It's a good idea to have a few drinks before you go. You'll be more relaxed and prospective chink donors won't be thrown off by your sobriety.<br> 
    4.) Don't feel that you're at the mercy of the men, that the choice in theirs. Of course it's not. Scan the bar and weasel your way into the general area of someone you'd like to talk to, or, if you're in a mercenary mood, someone who looks like an easy mark.<br>
    5.) Don't be afraid to start conversations (this is
  </p></div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
  <p class="justify">important). Any stupid premise will 
    do - i.e. "Great band" (this works better when there actually is a band), "Hot, isn't it?", "What kind of beer do they have on tap?", etc. Most men would actually like to chat with you but are afraid of being brushed off. <br>
    Exercise for the advanced hustler - It's just as easy to cultivate the right people as the wrong people so you might as well go to the source: The owner, the manager, and the bartender, in that order, are fair game. Bouncers can be useful too, but be warned, they assault people for a living and this can impact their interpersonal skills. Always remember to bring along a decoy "boyfriend" in case any of your targets become persistently overfriendly.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="centered">GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY<br> HUNTING, GIRLS!

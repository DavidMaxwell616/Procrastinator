      <h2><u>Beer Hustling in the Big City</u></h2>
      <br><h3>Tracy Measy</h3><br>
  <p class="justify">With relations between men and women in a wild state of flux, 
    and with the PC-ers suggesting that to open the door for a woman is demeaning 
    and sexist, it's high time for a practical exploration into the Politics of 
    Free Beer. Since the last time the editors were on either end of a free beer 
    was back in the days of the pop-top, they asked me to go undercover for one weekend, 
    to explore the soft underbelly of this hard-boiled city, the bar. The place 
    where mere acquaintances spill their whole sordid life stories to each other, 
    and where a total stranger will offer to buy you a drink...if you play

    <div class="col-sm-3">
    <p class="justify">your cards right. While it does happen that women spontaneously buy men drinks, this rare cutgence is difficult to document, and plays almost no part in this story. I cannot, in these pages intended for general consumption, relay the bizarre sequence of events that was to unfold °set that drunken weekend. but I have distilled my experience into some practical tips on hustling beer. As is often the case with us, your appearance may have more bearing on your success than your state of mind but, here are some guidelines for the young and the thirsty. I.) You should appear to be, if not alone, somewhat independent from your group of hiends 1 don't recommend trying this without some backup tanks you really know what you're doing). Standing alone or

<div class="col-sm-3">
  <p class="justify">appearing bored and actively scanning the room while standing with your friends works well. Men are afraid to approach whole groups They'd rather single you out horn the pack. 2.) Smile, look at least semi-alert. This makes you more approachable. 3.) It's a good idea to have • few drinks before you go. You'll be more relaxed and prospective chink donors won't be thrown off by your sobriety. 4.) Don't feel that you're at the enemy of the men, that the choice in theirs. Of course its not. Scan the bar and weasel your way into the general area of someone you'd like o talk to, or, if you're m a mercenary mood, someone who looks like an easy mark. S.) Don's be afraid o start conversation. (this is imponant). Any stupid premise will

<div class="col-sm-3">
  <p class="justify">do - i.e. 'Great band` (this works better when there actually is a band), 'Hot, Isn't UP, 'What kind of beer do they have on toe, etc. Most men would actually like to chat with you but an afraid of being brushed off. Excereise foe the advanced hustler Its jun es easy to cultivate the right people as the wrong people so y_ou might as well go to the source. The owner, the manager, and the bartenkr, in that coda, are fair game. Bouncers can be useful too, bur be warned, they assault peck for a living and this can impact on their intemencnal Always remember to bring along a decoy *boyfriend' in case any of your targets become persistency overfriendly. GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY HUNTING, GIRLS!

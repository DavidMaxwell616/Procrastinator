          <h2>SO YOU'RE SINGLE...</h2>
<p class="justify">And you aren't getting any younger. And all your friends
are getting married and living happily ever after, or 
at least haven't broken up.   Maybe you found the right 
person and lost them through carelessness, the same way 
you lost your bank-card and short-term memory. Or maybe 
you weren't ready to settle down. Or they've gone away 
somewhere: Bird- watching in Honduras or fighting fires 
in Oregon. And as the years tick by you know that you're 
not getting any more compatible, in fact you're getting 
downright bitter. Sure, there's a few flings on the back 
burner, but the idea of spending more than a few days a 
month with them is scary.  A platonic friend of the 
opposite sex  has subtly indicated that any display of 
physical affection would be warmly  encouraged and 
reciprocated. This inspires angst within your psyche 
and you feel uncomfortable standing next them. Then when 
you find someone you really like, you blow  it through 
overcompensation. You forget how to maintain an aloof 
demeanor and you wind up jumping every time the phone 
rings, sitting next to the phone and turning the light 
switch on and off  like Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" 
until you scare them away. Then, once the hurt has faded, 
you decide it's safer to stay single, since there's AIDS 
and all, right? AIDS and a heartbreak can be avoided if 
you can handle loneliness and longing. Right? Right? RIGHT?
Forget it, you need someone, and soon!<br><br>

Where can you turn? Maybe the personals, but they're all
using the 900 numbers now; you'd be wasting a lot of money.
 Also, you've got to wonder what kind of desperate, crazy 
nut would respond to (or place) an ad.  Are you really 
ready to lower yourself to the tawdry, shallow 
correspondence of sexual classifieds?  No, the best bet 
is to keep on going to parties and clubs (especially Mud 
gigs) and throwing yourself into the surf of singles with
all the carefree abandon your heart can muster.  Guys, 
you should stand against the wall and stare moodily around,
not talking to anybody. Girls, you should spot who you 
want and go after them ruthlessly. Buy the guys drinks for 
an eye-opening change of social behavior that will have 
them at your beck and call. Guys, you shouldn't expect 
anything more than a mumbled "thank you" when you buy a 
girl a drink. That's the oldest one in the book and 
besides, they probably make more money than you anyway. 
Money, ah yes, the second most important lubrication there 
is to buffer the natural abrasiveness between the sexes. 
Why? Because it buys

        <div class="col-sm-3">


        <p class="justify">alcohol. Alcohol brings down 
barricades. It gives men the courage to make advances. 
It gives women the ability to enjoy letting him. It 
loosens the tongue for confessions of personal pasts and 
hopes and true feelings. It gives the imbiber the strength 
to be able to say "I like you...a lot."
<br><br>
Besides staying drunk, the best thing to do if you're 
single is ask yourself, "What am I looking for?" Are you 
looking for a husband? A blonde? A back-rub? A drunken 
night of passion you won't remember? A week of infatuation 
followed by a month of dis- enchantment? Do you want an 
older woman who'll be the provider, so you can stay at home, 
play guitar all day and watch endless Simpsons tapes? Do 
you want a man who'll tell you what to do, because you're 
so indecisive? Do you want a woman who just wants you 
every other weekend? I ask the women: Do you care more 
about the bank account or the personality? Would you 
rather have a man who's funny, your age and poor, or a 
man who's boring, older and rich? What if he's funny, 
older and rich, but also is bald or has a hairy back? 
What if he has a full head of hair, naked back, is funny, 
older and rich, but jealous and dominating? What if he's 
young and rich, hair on top, not on back, but is an 
obnoxious, loud-mouthed murph? What if you like bald, 
hairy-backed men but yours turns out to like watching 
football more than sex? What if he's young, handsome, 
funny and rich, but a drug addict?  Does it matter how ugly 
he is, if he's got a great apartment, is hung like a 
thermos, and drives a Porsche? Does it matter how pretty 
he is if he's never home to look at? 
<br><br>
I ask the men: What's better, a beautiful bore, or a 
delightfully insane plain Jane? What if she's not 
attractive, but you have a great time with her? What's 
more important, peer pressure or the dictates of your own 
heart? What if she's so gorgeous that every man she meets
falls for her, and they all have more money, charisma and
connections than you? How long do you suppose she's going 
to ignore their lucrative offers? What type of girl are you 
looking for; a quick "lay" or the physical manifestation 
of the goddess that has haunted your dreams all your life? 
Are you looking for a beautiful woman who is easily 
seduced, who you can meet at a bar, take home and sleep 
with the same night? Is this the type of girl you can 
count on for eventual monogamy? Or are you looking for a 
girl who won't give you the time of day the first time 
she meets you, who's shy and withdrawn, but who might come 
around to your side of the table, once you put in enough 
weeks of wining and dining? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
      <p class="justify"> where else can you go, but 
a bar, to meet people? I mean, you sure as hell don't go 
to church anymore!  These are questions you need to ask 
yourself in order to commence romantic ventures. What's 
more important, big breasts or big heart? Are you scared 
by intelligent women and annoyed by dumb ones? Are you 
put off by dominance, yet  you desire security? What if 
she's smart, funny and gorgeous, yet smokes a vile brand 
of cigarettes, (assuming you've quit) and yet she won't 
let you smoke pot around her, or complains about your 
drinking "problem", or hates Howard Stern? Does it matter 
how beautiful she is, if she's a bitch? Does it matter how 
wonderful she is, if she's ugly?

So many questions for singles to ask themselves as they 
sit before their third beer and cast their fish hook eye 
into the sea of single faces at the bar. The sad fact, as 
any career single knows, is that relationships form 
spontaneously.  All the longing in the world won't 
hasten the unseen forces  that will throw the love of your 
life right in your lap. You'll look in to each others eyes 
and know, instantly: Ba-Boom!!  that you were meant to be. 
You can become infatuated, but the relationship will always 
fade into the self-created contrivance it was. This might 
be fun for a while, but what if your true love appears to 
you while you're involved in a superficial relationship of 
convenience, causing your temp lover pain? Just remember 
that what goes around comes back around when your single, 
so be prepared for the best and the worst of it. If you 
stay single, you can be comforted by the thought that you 
will cause no pain should you run off with Miss/Mr. Right 
the second you lay eyes on them. You are good to go. No 
strings attached. And in the meantime, you can flirt, 
flirt, flirt your little head off. You can stay out all 
night and not call home to feign remorse and concoct 
excuses. You never have to fight over whose relatives to 
spend the holidays with. In fact you don't have to adjust 
your behavior to meet the approval of anyone else's set of 
friends or relatives at all! And while you're waiting for 
the right person to come along, you can be  developing the 
skills that are essential to maintaining a healthy 
relationship, such as patience, thoughtfulness, compassion
 and faith. Feel free to explore all the sides of yourself 
that you won't be able to when "spoken for". You are able 
to develop independence and freedom of choice, with no 
significant other to take the blame for your weaknesses. 
You have nobody to project on, and so must deal with your 
inner self mano a mano. You have no shoulder to cry on, 
and so you cry less. You have no one to hold you to their 
bosom in the dark and purr</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3"><p class="justfy">"It's all right, baby, it's 
all right." You have no security blanket, no thumb to suck 
on. You must face the root of your anxiety and and you 
must endure a few bad nights until-Voila! It goes away on 
its own! You, as a single, are liberated from co-dependence!
Hurrah! You watch only the channels you choose. You are in 
complete control.
<br><br>
All the times you feel lonely as a single are the times 
when, in some parallel world, you're happily coupled. But 
all the times when you're content to be single, in a 
parallel world you'd be feeling claustrophobic, aching for 
a weekend apart, worrying "Is this it?"
<br><br>
A student of Socrates once asked him, "Should I marry?"
"It doesn't matter," replied Socrates, "In five years 
you'll regret either decision." 
<br><br>
That means that both answers require sacrifice. In both 
instances you will always wonder if the other road may 
have been less bumpy. Love is a wonderful thing, but it 
doesn't always survive between two people who are 
constantly evolving, growing and reaffirming their 
individuality. It would be a colossally unfair universe 
if  happiness could only be found in the arms of another. 
Love is to be found everywhere, and it is love itself, 
not the beloved, that brings happiness. Without a mate, 
one is free to find other outlets for their enormous, 
hidden reserves of love. Whether one loves a pet, a group 
of friends, a rockin' band, a good beer, a Woody Allen 
film, Hate Comics, the Simpsons, pea-bud, an old Fender 
amp, sushi, a shot of bourbon, a hot tub after 
snowboarding, or Blind Blake's recording of "Skeedle-Oo-Doo"
all that matters is that you love and love HARD! Love is a
skill that is always in need of sharpening and refining. 
You should pursue the things you love with gusto, with 
endless tenacity. Savor the food you eat, dance to the 
music you hear, shower your friends with affection and 
confetti, weep with joy at your favorite movie, learn to 
play (or write) your favorite songs, write letters to 
long dead movie stars. The outlet for your love is 
irrelevant as long as it is expressed loudly and with all 
your heart.

So the next time you're at a party and you're feeling 
self-consciously single, remember this: You can stay up as 
long as you want, get as drunk as you want, leave when 
when you want (don't drive) or  fall asleep in a stranger's 
arms, and nobody can find any fault with you. You are free 
for the asking.

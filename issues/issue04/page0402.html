          <p class="justify">SYRACUSE, NY - The salvation Army has long been a bastion of good deeds and sacrifice. Mel Kregstel, a Syracuse native and regular 
            at the Earthwyn Supper Club, recently took a giant step for mankind by donating his foot to the religion organisation. 
            Seeing the error of his ways, Kregstel enlisted his foot the Salvation Anny on a "journey of selflessness." The enlistment, an elaborate sidewalk ceremony that Kregstel designed, 
            left Army officials both horrified and hungry. They politely accepted the gift and swore that the foot would be reeducated and thenceforth devoted to a life of giving and helping.

        The foot was unavailable for comment, because feet cannot talk. "But he sure is light!", spat a nearby homeless man, EH,
        who is now appearing with the foot as part of his act at "Tea Here Now" on Westcott Street.

      The Mexican Mud song, "Love Boat", has attracted a lot of attention for being patently offensive. Riots have been erupting anywhere a critical mass of people 
      have gathered who believe the "Shoot the Bitch" verse of the song denegrates women. A crowd swarming a Frayzee's Fish Market spontaneously riled themselves
      into a frenzy over the matter. Chanting incoherently, the rioters burned effigies of Mud members, tarred and feathered a store clerk,
      and fondled several crustaceans. Before police arrived, however, a somewhat lucid rioter pointed out that the Mud
      were nowhere near Neptune, and had no affiliation with the now half-destroyed fish market.

            The infamous chain letter that rocked the media last week has recently 
            been found to be a cruel hoax. The letter, which alleged chicken soup to be an effective form of birth control, 
            was recently refuted by Oxford Combs, Spokesman for US Chickens Inc.

            Security immediately descended and tore Hector to shreds, later vomiting him back up to feed their young. 
            Hector says he is satisfied with this new position and likes living inside 4 baby chicks. "Dey are berra Kute" commented Hector.

            <p class="justify">HECTOR ENRIQUE AGAV&Eacute; has been a constant source of controversy and mystery in the media for the past seven years. 
              Since taking on the position of manager of the Mexican Mud Band in 1986, his reputation as a swindler, cheat, drunkard, philanderer and media pig 
              has grown considerably and has become a source of great concern for Mudmen and civilians alike. The Procrastinator has been tracking Agav&eacute 
              ever since his libel suit with the Mud began pending in 1988. We managed to squeeze a few comments out of this elusive condiment when we found him 
              at Barnes & Noble signing his new book "My Life in a Bottle: Words of a Hallucinogen" (McGraw Hill, $27.59).<p>

            HA: You ate Pepe - you people are not only poorly dressed but very unceeveelized. You cannot eat me! I am beeg media star now! Instead, rake a shot of my limo - ees Monte Alban - ees your favorite.. yes?

            AGAV&Eacute;: I try to book the geegs. Mainly I fail, and so just enjoy myself. So, I am like nun managers, have another leetle shot.<br><br>
            MWSM: We'll drink Your liquor, but we won't be nice to you (Editor's note: this is company policy). Hector, you are still a worm no matter how many books you sell.<br><br>
            AGAV&Eacute;: Yes, my malodorous amigo, for now I am a worm in a man's world, but someday, when you're dead and buried, your pale gringo face turned to the sun, you will be a man in a worm's world and it will be our turn to feast on your flesh. This is worse, no?<br><br>

              WHO ARE THESE WANNABES?<br> 
              Let's face it: when you go out to a club, you have to expect a certain number of annoyances and indignities - haughty poseurs (usually musicians), leering bouncers, expensive drinks and bodily injury ranging from mashed toes to cigarette burns.<br><br>
              But these problems pale in comparison to a more harmful, incidious occurrence that has been killing buzzes all over town - those random jonesers who jump up on stage with bands and pretend to play percussion. Not only do they force as all to witness their unwitting
              </p>

              humiliation, but they distract both the band and the audience from the groove, which is why we paid ten backs to get in, right?<br><br>
              OK, there are people in the audience who can't tell that you don't belong up there, or that you've never played bongoes in your life. Those clueless people constitute a group that you could potentially impress, just by being on stage and shaking your hair around. But the rest of us (anyone who's more than half-awake, has seen the band before, or knows where the accents of the beat are) 
              can only regard you with pity and loathing. Realize this, and mend your ways before you become the target of a

            <p class="justify">            
              well-deserved blow, or worse, having people laugh and sneer at you. Obviously, not every spontaneous addition to the band falls into this category. People who have some talent often add to a band's sound - although you should wait to be specifically invited up even if you are a smoking drummer.<br><br>
              So what can be done about this problem? The Mexican Mud Band has an interesting solution. Instead of continuing to play and allowing the unwanted upstart to appear as if they're blending into the rhythm and the context of the song, The Mud allows the person a solo, accenting the "one" in the beat, and thus the person's

              arhythmic playing stands out and the intruder, not the band suffers. The crowd can enjoy a person making a fool out of themselves when the song becomes a musical comedy, and not sabotage. Just because you're drunk and crave admiration does not justify your unwarranted presence 
              on stage. If you really want to be a performer, get ready for long hours of seemingly fruitless practicing and lifting heavy equipment. If you're not willing to commit yourself to a life of drudgery, then it's your lot to have to impress people one at a time. You can start by buying that cute girl a beer.

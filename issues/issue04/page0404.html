        <h2>ON THE TRAIL OF THE MUD '93:<br> 
          The Labor Day Tour</h2>
          <h3>NYC • SYRACUSE • OSWEGO • SENECA FALLS • ROCHESTER • NYC•</h3>
         <b><u>THURSDAY 3:45 AM: NYC- FLANNERY'S PUB</u></b><br>
        <p class="justify">I'm already having second thoughts about going...Look at these guys! The bar is empty, the equipment's packed up, I'm wasted, tired, sweaty. The Mud is arguing over whether or not to pay the opening band. They promised $30, but Scott says "Promises, shmomises." His eyes are alive with greed. Dave looks up from his notebook, "Tomorrow," he says, displaying great leadership, "be ready to leave at 2 pm-SHARP! 2 pm, got it? This once we're going to leave on time!" 
        We all agree, except Matt who has curled up in his bass drum case and fallen asleep. Quietly, so as not to wake hlm, we close the lid gently and lock him in. Then we start kicking it.<br><br>
        </p>
        <b><u>FRIDAY: 1 PM: NYC - MAX'S APARTMENT</u></b><br>
        I wake from a dream to find that I'm sleeping with Scott on Max's fold-out. I try to get bock to sleep. In my dream, I wasn't sleeping with Scott, that's for sure. Scott starts trying to get me to call Dave. I ignore him and wander off to the deli.<br><br>
        <b><u>2 pm:</u></b><br>
        Scott and I are showered, fed, packed, ready and waiting for Dave's call. No calls come so we start watching "The Simpsons" on Max's VCR.<br><br>
        <b><u>2:30 pm:</u></b><br>
        Alter unsuccessfully trying to get me to do it, Scott calls Dave and Don. Don answers. Scott says something in a Jerky Boys accent and Don hangs up.<br><br>
        <b><u>3 pm:</u></b><br>
        We are into our third Simpsons episode. Scott calls again. No answer.<br><br>
        <b><u>3:30 pm:</u></b><br>
        Don calls. He's at a diner. He says he got lost looking for the van and got hungry. He'll look for it again soon and get back to us. First, he'll have a bowl of borscht, fries, 2 bottles of ketchup, 3 coffees, 13 Merit Ultra Lights and a water. He leaves no tip.<br><br>
        <b><u>4:30 pm:</u></b><br>
       Scott and I are finally picked up by the van. By now it is an incredibly hot and humid afternoon In the Big Apple. We must now drive uptown to pick up Matt who won't meet us downtown because he's sore about the drum case incident. It is a sweltering rush hour, and it takes 45 minutes to crawl up 8th avenue.<br><br>
       <b><u>5:30 pm: IN FRONT OF MATT'S APPARTMENT, NYC</u></b><br>
       Dave goes upstairs to get Matt. "I'll be right down", he says. While Matt and Dave commiserate and eat lunch upstairs, Don decides to get out of the van and wanders off in search of a deli to get a coke and more cigarettes. The rest of us stay, sweating like crazy, in the van, until we realize Dave and Matt have no intention of coming down, and we get out.<br><br>
       <b><u>6:00 pm:</u></b><br>
       Dave and Matt come down. Now we're ready to go. Don, however, is nowhere in sight.<br><br>
       <b><u>6:10 pm:</u></b><br>
       Mark goes to lock for Don.<br><br>
       <b><u>6:30 pm:</u></b><br>
        Don returns, pizza and 40 oz beer in hand. "Where's Mark?" he asks cheerfully.<br><br>
        <b><u>6:45 pm:</u></b><br>
        Mark returns, with ginger ale, whiskey and cigars. His expression is earnest as he addresses me in a low voice "Shangly, man...bourbon sale at the Bingee Mart." I immediately leap from the van and head for the Bingee.<br><br>

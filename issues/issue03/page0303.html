  How many of you think you're unusual? Of course you do. Who
  doesn't? Weirdness isn't a curse, nor is it a prize, a badge of honor
  that lords us over the dull masses. It is a duty, a calling and divine
  inheritance. We cling to our difference, lest we fade into the
  banality that has already consumed much of our generation. 
  We must learn to be weird CORRECTLY! There is
  good weird and bad weird. Therefore this article will serve
  not only curious du11ards, but the freaks and flakes as well. Let's go,
  step-by-step, through the rules of weird-for-weird's-sake and build
  a better scene for us all to rage in, a scene free of both banality and
  obnoxiousness.  
  <br><br>
  RULE ONE: BE WEIRD FOR WEIRD'S SAKE. 
  Unusual behavior shouldn't be a pretension acquired to garner 
  attention. If you're bland, a scary fashion accessory won't help you. 
  It might be the trigger you need  to set you off, but it won't be the 
  bullet. If you want to get the ball flying, your heart must be in the 
  right place. Anyone can get their navel pierced, what's important, 
  what matters is the political importance attached to the 
  target. Body piercing, tattooing and hair dying is important as a 
  ritual, rite of passage, physical mainifestation of psychological 
  change, whatever. If you're truly weird, pierced navels and purple. 
  hair matter little; it's the glint in the eye that speaks everything. If 
  we say you have "the look", with your dreads, Doc Martens and 
  ridiculously baggy pants. If that tattoo is going to make you feel 
  gorgeous or exciting, if it will stir up trouble, anger your parents 
  and shock the system, by all means get it; but if you just want 
  to be different and are afraid, deep down, that you're not, save 
  your money and your skin. Weirdness must be developed 
  from within before it is manifested without. A really 
  weird person doesn't need long hair, tattoos, body-pierces, or 
  anything else to alienate the normals. A truly weird person is 
  weird for weird's sake, not to get attention. If a person is truly 
  ready, the tattoo will manifest itself through the legitimate 
  metaphysical channels. A genuine freak understands that 
  personality flows from within, not vice versa. Dangerous thinking is 
  liberation. Bizarre behavior is its own reward. If any other reward 
  is earned, the act logically ceases to be weird. To do something 
  when It will benefit you in no way whatsoever, and to do it for this 
  very reason, is the essence of art-EXCEPT in the following all- 
  too common instances. 
  <br><br>
  -- WHEN IT ANNOYS OTHER WEIRD PEOPLE. 
  The line between weird and obnoxious is a mile thick but most of the
  drunken clods who cross it are blind enough to hop the

          distance in record time. Perhaps they are still trapped 1n their shell of 
          normality and can't admit it, bat for some reason, when liquored 
          up and confused by emotion, they tend to go ridiculous lengths to 
          prove the extent of their liberation. Seeing an attractive 
          person of the opposite sex, they make lewd passes designed to fail. 
          Seeing people dancing, they feel obliged to dance as well; and they 
          prove so drunkenly inept at this that the dancing going on all 
          around them is forced to abate, and an uncomfortable air 
          unsettles the mood. The real dancers' beers become 
          endangered, and they all stand there, watching and shaking their 
          heads, until the dullard-in-dancer's-dress grows bored, dizzy 
          and dry, finally going back to the bar, as out of sync with the music 
          and the other dancers as he was in the beginning. These poor saps 
          confuse ecstatic spirituality with petty destructiveness and boorish 
          manners. They are loud talkers and rarely let the softer speakers 
          get a word in. The are so full of themselves that there is no room 
          for anything else and those around them are compelled to 
          freeze, like mannequins whose only purpose is to listen, nod and 
          laugh approvingly. I have, myself, known what fun such self- 
          absorbed obnoxiousness can be. However, I have always lived to regret 
          it. The fact is, when you step on other cool people's buzzes, 
          you step on your own.  
          <br><br>
          --WHEN INJURY OR DEATH IS TOO STRONGLY COURTED. 
          Driving weird is unacceptable, for example. Acting 
          weird towards a policeman who has pulled you over is, similarly, 
          not advisable. It is the curse of the weird that so much weird 
          behavior winds up in accidental injury, death or incarceration. 
          weirdness and good judgment too rarely go hand-in- hand. 
          au can be weird and still wear your seatbelt. You don't have to 
          dance along the edge of a rooftop at dawn, drunk out of your mind, 
          to impress us. The fear that we feel watching you make a fool of 
          yourself is neither liberating nor fun. We're afraid we'll have to 
          call an ambulance, spend sobering hours in the hospital 
          lounge and later tell our friends at you're in traction. The 
          damage you would bring upon yourself would taint all of our 
          future weird behavior with its repercussions. It might be weeks 
          until we start acting like freaks again. We might even be shocked 
          into settling down. Similarly, over-indulging in drugs or 
          alcohol, far beyond the levels you're used to isn't brave at all, 
          but silly. Pacing and tolerance-awareness are your best tools for l
          enjoying a wild night out; they shouldn't be what you're rebelling 
          against or trying to transcend. This is sound advice I remind 
                </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">

        myself of all the time, and still forget the minute my buzz is on.
        The hardest thing for a hedonist to master is self-discipline. If the
        hedonist can, raging continues. If they can't, the alternatives are
        tragic: jail, rehab, the morgue, or... normality. 
         <br><br>
        -- WHEN IT'S NOT POSITIVE!
        Anybody can be weird in a bad way. Just grab a weapon and
        start swinging! Pat drugs in the puppy's food, tell misogynistic
        stories at parties, sulk in the corner, refuse to participate, talk
        about factory farming at the dinner table (my favorite). In this
        all too grim world, your excess evil is not needed. Wrap your
        weird energy in positive light. Instead of pouring a beer on your
        friend's head, offer him a funnel See how confused they are at this
        sudden out of place act of generosity. Spontaneous gifts and
        compliments are so seldom given amongst our socially skewed
        generation that they actually have good shock value. You'll freak
        someone out a lot more by bringing them flowers then you
        will by dumping live roaches in their bed. Roaches they know how
        to deal with, but flowers? Watch them stammer out amazed thank-
        yous, watch their face turn red as they fumble around for a vase;
        have a good laugh at their expense. Next time you're at a
        party, befriend some lonely soul in the corner whom you'd never
        normally notice, given that you know every one else there and
        they know no one. Such a bizarre act will benefit everyone in ways
        you cannot foresee. Remember: you can catch more flies with
        sugar than with arsenic, and the truly weird person likes to catch
        lots of flies. 
<br><br>
        RULE TWO: FIGHT NORMALITY WITH BOTH FISTS OPEN. 
        When the bizarre and unusual ceases it's fight, normality and 
        inertia settle in. Like death, they are both always victorious. 
        Keeping our lives nonsensical is a daily battle. Weary of the 
        endless days on the  root lines, we start to fantasize 
        about the simple life we left behind. We think of mom waiting  
        for us back home, apple pie in the oven, stern lecture about "getting 
        serious" waiting to drop from pop's lips, and we want to quit the 
        fight and get back in time for a slice and some guilt. Buffeted by a  
        harsh climate of uncertainty, death-cognizance and poorly  
        defined peer relationships, we retreat from the front, get a thirty 
        year pass and spend the rest of our lives recovering from the little  
        bedroom mom kept just so. We turn our backs on the fight and  
        flee to rest, rehabilitation, to responsibility and respect for 
        restriction. We find solace in the stupid sitcoms and game shows, 
        their very stupidity a comfort

      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p class="justify">
        after all the painful evolving 
        we've done. Our overstretched souls are soothed by supermarket 
        tabloids. Our lives are willfully forgotten and we live Roseanne 
        Barr's or Julia Roberts' instead. We pull a reverse Peter Pan, 
        refusing to stay young. Instead of living in fire, we sit in the living
        room, soaking in television water until our burns heal.
        <br><br>
        RULE THREE: KNOW THE SCRIPTURES AND KEEP'EM HOLY. 
        The guides to successful weirdness are everywhere. Thank 
        God, for without them, we would be an army without ammunition. 
        Luckily, we have a rich body of transcendentally bizarre works to
        suffuse us with inspiration and motivation. The classic seers of 
        weird for weird's sake are the Marx Brothers; any of their first
        seven films is a text in using irreverence as a way to 
        enlightenment. Jack Kerouac understands that, and he's up 
        there with them. On our own current front we have the 
        Mexican Mud Band, whose antics and songs are apt illustrators for
        weird-for-weird's sake humor. Other patron saints of the bizarre
        include: Sun Ra, (early) Woody Allen, William S. Burroughs, 
        Camille Paglia, Lao Tze, Chucklehead, Zippy the Pinhead, 
        Shakespeare, W.C. fields, Orson Welles, Salvador Dali, James 
        Joyce, Tom Waits, Carl Jung, Stanley Kubrick, Hieronymous 
        Bosch, Aldous Huxley, Frank Zappa, Bela Lugosi, Nicholas 
        Cage, Lou Reed, W.B. Yeats, Robin Williams, H.R. Giger, 
        Peter Breugel, Bob Dylan, the Marquis de Sade, Cary Grant, 
        George Clinton, Ed Wood, Jr., Dav1d Lynch and, of course, 
        Sigmund Freud. They have all helped us keep the door slightly 
        ajar in the darkroom of the unconscious, enabling the Less 
        perceptive to get more than just a prostrating glimpse into the great
        unknown. Not only that, but through their attitudes and 
        humor, they instruct us how to cope with the burden of seeing 
        "too much", for life is scary without the security blanket of 
        normality around us. In opening oar eyes to transcendental beauty,
        we also open our eyes to the ever-present horror and death that we 
        normally shut out. These great explorers of the psyche can teach
        you how to laugh at the cosmic joke. They've proven that what 
        doesn't make any sense is really all that does. By attaching 
        importance to meaninglessness, they liberate the mind. They 
        confront the horrifying void of ultimate reality and crack jokes.
        They supply us with the courage to come face-to-face with the 
        scariest sight of all, ourselves, and laugh in our own face. Thus, in
        keeping ourselves surrounded by their work, we keep the 
        ever present normality at bay. 
<br><br>        
        Stay weird.

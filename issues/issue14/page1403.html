  <h2>PROCRASTINATOR HELPLINE: COPING WITH MATURITY</h2> 
  <p class="justify">
    Maturity, the end of the beginning? Not if you do it right. Maturation can leave you like a fine wine, more potent and tasty as you age, or it can leave you like an unrefrigerated bagel: crusty, hardened and bland. We at the PROCRASTINATOR have the PROCRASTINATOR as our means of avoiding the latter fate, but you, the twentysomething reader sliding ever and ever up the ladder to a midlife crisis, what do you have? Luckily, you have us; we're here to help you age in style, to mature by becoming less obnoxious, not less fun; to become more self-confi-dent, yet less arrogant; to eat better, and yet still feel sickly. Here are a few easy guidelines: 
  <br><br>1. Make Murphy's Law Work for You! 
  By now you know that everything that can go wrong, will. Why not take advantage? If you're hungry at a restaurant and the waitress is taking forever, light up a smoke, and your food will appear instantly! Going camping and hoping for sunny weather? Pack an umbrella. The weather will be ideal for swimming, provided you don't pack a bathing suit. If you want to wind up in bed with a stranger tonight, make sure there are no condoms in your wallet. And when you're going out on the town, always plan for a disastrous time, you'll never be disappointed. 
  <br><br>2. Pretend to, but really take nothing, seriously. 
  The jokes on you if you take yourself too seriously. Anyone with a high opinion of themselves is an open target for ridicule, if however, you're willing to ridicule yourself, you're a boring target. Imagine how dull the Mans. Bros. would find tormenting Margaret Dumont if she knew how to laugh at her own expense. Life is just a brief flash between long stretches of death and sleep. Why not join the winning team and stay detached from the folly of the workaday world? 
  <br><br>3. Learn the art of Selective Incompetence and Surreptitious Unreliability 
  One uniquely American trait is the act of cost-effective work-shirking. It is important to be rec-ognized for your abilities and your industrious stamina. However, this usually requires exertion of some kind. The key to camouflaging your inertia is to delegate to invisible peons and to Icownplay the role of tedium in your job requirements. If you convince superiors that a job is too menial, they will seek another, more anonymous employee.

  <h2>NEW EVIDENCE REVEALS MUD MEMBERS LINKED TO BIZARRE MIDGET SMUGGLING RING</h2> 
  <p class="justify">
    Union City (NJ) residents Emma Chubbiman and Chaim K. Ottick brought forth evidence to support claims of the Mud's alleged complicity in the infamous "Dwarfs on the Wharf' smuggling ring prevalent on Manhattan's East Side docks of the late 1920's. 
    "I doubt it's true, considering they were bom in the late sixties," said an overenthusiastic Mud spokesman Mephisto Dolores "but all publicity is sacred, so we gratuitously perpetuate any slanderous myths."

  <h2>AUNT ACID INDICTED FOR CONSPIRACY, NEGLIGENCE AND SHORTSIGHTEDNESS</h2> 
  <p class="justify">
    In what was possibly the shortest literary coup in history, Aunt Acid, beloved and well-respected columnist at the PROCRASTINATOR, has been arraigned on charges of "criminal lunacy", "ill-ederacy", "poor stenography" and "misanthropy". 
 <br><br> Quotes one bloated Mexican official "Er a establo no dos dienega" which Aunt Acid herself might have been able to translate we she still at our offices. Instead, nothing but her frail and hairless head could be seen as she was shuffled through the transcendental bucolic iron mess halls that constitute Northeastern penitentiary for Women where she is being held without bail and without official causes. 
 <br><br>A brief search of her desk at our offices revealed possible clues, and gave us a scoop only the PROCRASTINATOR could find. "Ladies and Gentlemen" I said, (me being there, as part of the story this time and not just a loafing reporter on the sidelines) "Aunt Acid is a man in dis-guise! No He Is Not!" I was puzzled by my own statement and sat down for a cigarette, Did they know about me? Was I a woman in disguise as a man, or was it the other around?-0r both? What had Dr. Norton always told me during those bad years at the clinic? What did he say I was supposed to keep telling myself if I had another "spell"? The faces of those around me grew deformed and repugnant to my suddenly heightened senses...(cont'd on page 3),

 <h2>AM I OUT OF TOUCH?</h2> 
 <p class="justify">
  If you have asked yourself this question incessantly (I know I have) and wonder whether your sensitive, post-slacker 9-to-5 ideals and humor have become excessively self-absorbed, or whether you are out of touch with mainstream ideals of today's capricious post-grunge "Offspring" and "Green Day" addled youth, you had better wake up and smell the Zima or forget any marketing potential you may have. The editors of this publication were concerned with some residual sensitivity left over from their 80s college experience, and they embarked upon a journey in quest of Complete Desensitization. It is kind of like the backrubbing male-oriented retreats of the Reagan era, but the opposite. It is sponsored by Brut Gingrich, bastard offspring of the Speaker.

  Erich and Max: Tough Enough? 
 <hr class="double">
  <h2>BEST GROCERY LISTS OF 1994</h2>
  <br>
  1. From December 22nd: Ginger Ale, peanuts, salsa, toilet paper, beer, seltzer, potato chips 
  <br><br>2. From March 1st: Teriyaki Sauce, string beans, cilantro, olive oil, chili powder 
  <br><br>3. From August 3rd: Frozen Spinach (8 oz package), beer, pie crusts, ricotta cheese, salsa, guacamole chips, eggs, trash bags. 
  <br><br>RUNNERS UP: The lists from October were all especially well-composed, but often omitted essentials that had to be picked up at a later hour, sometimes when dinner was mere minutes rom the table. Still, there was a verve and a flair to the braveness of "steak, potatoes (red), cilantro, pinto beans, ketchup, asparagus" that defied normal linearity, shunned the typical banal references to mixers and beer and established a sort of "nouveau-assemblage-oriche d'e;deurvre oeuvre" unprecedented in the field of abstract grocery list writing.

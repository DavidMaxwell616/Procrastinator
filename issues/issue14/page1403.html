  <h2>X MARKS THE JONESER 
  </h2> 
  <p class="justify">
    Know your joneser. He is everywhere. He is reading this over your shoulder right now because he is too cheap to buy his own, even though this is free. Know him. Know the feel of his breath on the nape of your neck. He (or she) is the one demanding, asking all the time, "Will you get me high?" while they don't have any of their own. Their appetite exceeds yours, but you have a bag, and they don't. They end up smoking more of yours than you do. Is this fair? No, but the joneser doesn't think in this way. Know your joneser. When the joneser arrives at your apartment they are empty-handed, but soon they have found plenty of beers...in YOUR fridge. When the hat is passed around for a case, the joneser laments they haven't gone to the bank machine, that they "aren't in the mood to drink anymore" though you know this mood will pass with the arrival of a cold case of Bass. The joneser then asks if it is okay to smoke. You grudgingly allow it, but it then turns out that they have no cig-arettes and jones one off of you. You have depleted your pocket supply and are forced to deplete your emergency stash. Know your joneser. 
    <br><br>  Why? You may wonder. Since there is nothing you can do. You cannot confront a joneser about his jonesing. The joneser is too clever, too cunning. They will whip the words back at you and all the rest of the crowd will think you are "stingy". So just lie low, knowing the joneser knows that you know that they are a joneser. You are onto them, and the time will come soon that vengeance is thine. In the meantime, hide the beers in the crisper, break your bag down into tiny stashes so you can make a point of how little you have left. And most impertinent, stop smoking all together.

  <h2>LIVING WITH LUST</h2> 
  <p class="justify">
    Especially here in New York City, a simple walk down the street in summer can tum your once obedient body into a surge of raging lustful pheremone phenomena. A gorgeous model walks by in a skin tight, low cut summer frock, and guys and girls practically buckle over in longing and animal desire. Old, steady relationships are put to the test, and single guys seriously debate suicide, as an almost insurmountable frustration of sexual desire pervades the air. 
    <br><br>    How can you cope with all this lovely, exposed, sun and smog ripened flesh? You want to own it all, r- it and touch it and kiss it so badly that even to have just one wouldn't be near enough. ,f you can't sleep with every woman who walks by, life just isn't worth living and you start to cry. How can you train your eyes not to ravage every form you find appealing? The poor women walk around feeling like pieces of meat in a starving lion's den. Meanwhile, sound and rewarding relationships are put into jeopardy by the endless sea of promising faces. Where can you turn? Certainly not to the Lord. Turn to your heart, know these women are all sinners, whores and scar-mongers (don't ask me what that means) and know that the little woman who is waiting for you just when you come home at night, is all you really need. Yes, that little woman. How tall is she now? Just keep watering her and waiting and soon she will be big enough to take out with you! Oh God, I cannot wait to go home and get drunk, alone, in front of the television! All the way home I will wear blinders so that I do not see the sea of beautiful women, and I will be free...FREE!

 <h2>MAX'S ONE-HIT WONDER QUIZ</h2> 
 <p class="justify">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
  1. This band topped the charts in 1983 with the cloying but catchy syrup ballad "Harden My Heart". An opportunistic agent and a fickle public left this erzatz Pat Benatar ensemble out in the cold. 
  <br><br>2. Their name first came from the bubblegum music of the early seventies. They had a brief moment of stardom with their hit "Willy Won't Go Home" in 1972, then faded away like so many Osmonds and Archies. 
  <br><br>3. He had joy, he had fun, but only one season in the sun in 1978. A bitter divorce matched with stiff California reciprocity laws left this balladeer dangling by his 1040s. 
  <br><br>4. They used the public's fascination with gangsters as a springboard to stardom with their 1975 hit "The Night Chicago Died". Unfortunately, there were one too many similar sounding and looking bands for them to keep their heads above water. 
  <br><br>5. This scarf wearing Scottish group had a 1977 hit entitled "Magic", until other falsetto voiced power groups like Yes, Styx and Supertramp edged this feeble clone out of the picture, along with April Wine and Asia.
  <br><br>6. Arguably the most memorable phone number in history (aside from 970-FIST), "867-5309" caught the MTV wave in 1981 and brought this "Johnny Two-note" a brief flicker of stardom.

  <h3>FILM</h3><br> 
  <i><b>The Bridges of Diehard County (Starring: Clint Eastwood and Bruce Willis)</b></i> 
  <br>
  <p class="justify">
    A tepid yawner in which elements of the Die Hard films co-mingle with country bumpkin soap opera. Detective Rory Calhoun (Willis) plays a drifting, alcoholic NYPD detective who, after getting lost on his way to a drunk driving rally, manages to fall desperately in love with a local sheriff (tenderly played by Clint Eastwood) who teaches him skeet shooting and rodeo riding (with a Willis ina hilarious horse get-up!) Their banal buddy-buddy bonding is enhanced by a couple of songs (if you can believe it, Clint sings even better than he did in Paint Your Wagon) and a neat fanta-sy interlude. Nevertheless, this is hackneyed stuff we've seen before (Kurt and Sly lid it better in Last Tango in Tango & Cash) - C 
  </p>
  <i><b>Species (Starring: Rory Calhoun, Jeff Bridges) </b></i>
  <p class="justify">
    Jeff Bridges overacts horrendously in this glum turkey about a run-amok alien (played by Calhoun in a brilliantly understated costume) who attempts to splice his genes with those of Calvin Klein. In the ensuing fashion holocaust, replete with a 
    cameo by a demented Gloria Vanderbilt, we lose something in the feel for the characters. Obviously this is just to play for the lawyers for Bridges, whose delusional lawsuit against the makers of "Bridges of DieHard County" is still boring viewers on CNN. Wait for the video. - D+

  <h3>BOOKS</h3><br> 
  <i><b>Teeth Like an Olive by John Grisham (Mangled Press, 345 pgs. hardcover $44.99)</b></i> 
<br> <p class="justify">
  In a startling new direction, acclaimed mega-success John Grisham takes leave of backwoods lawyer intrigue to bring us the laconic tale of a dissatisfied slacker couple (astoundingly played astoundingly nothing more than a string of words on paper) who invest in a small olive grove. Complications arise when the thirsty older brother appears out of nowhere with a huge vat of gin and some dry vermouth. Grisham uses his standard methods of slowly building the unrelenting suspense as the olive supply starts to mysteriously dwindle. Is the brother responsible...or is it something far more sinister? After 300 pages, you won't care either. - B+ 
</p>
<i><b>Wacker by Stephen King (Knopf & Handler, 2,635 pgs, $44.99) </i></b>
<br> <p class="justify">
  It seems Stephen King will never tire of tales about household appliances run amok. Henry, a garden variety weed wacker absorbs the soul of a rabid squirrel it accidentally decapitates. Soon, the weedwacker is developing a life of its own, pursuing carrots and taking revenge on a John Deere mower (Rory Calhoun, in a brilliantly understated performance) At over 2,000 pages, one wonders if Mr. King should get out of the house once in a while. Surely carpal tunnel syndrome is imminent. In the meantime, King fans should have no complaints. - A

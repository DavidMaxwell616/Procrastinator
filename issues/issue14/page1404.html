   <h2>ALCOHOL: MAN'S MUCH MALIGNED MASTER 
  </h2>
    <h3>
    (or "I'm not a drunkard just because I drink more than you") 
  </h3>
<br>
    <p class="justify">
  Alcohol is a ferocious power, a simultaneous curse and a saviour. It can turn a mouse into a lion, it can turn a man into a drooling idiot, it can kill, it can cure. It can make ugly seem beautiful, relax muscles, ease grief and suffering, stimulate conversation and good will. It can fog the memory of last night while also making last night memorable. It is poetic justice, a terrible cure: a deal with the devil, a miracle, and it must not be blamed for the frailties and weaknesses of its users. Alcohol has been accused of everything from hampering motor skills to causing war and "health problems". Well, this may be so, but don't let them say that alcohol doesn't masse you funnier more lik-able, or more popular. The nay-sayers argument is "He isn't really funnier or more likable when he's drinking, he just thinks he is." 
  <br><br>   But isn't thinking you are popular really what its all about? They might say "He only thinks he has self-confidence," an utterly absurd statement. If you make people laugh, you are funny, but the poo-pooers of alcohol will disagree. They will say people are laugh-ing at you, not with you, or they will say that their laughter is a sublimation of pity or concern. They are foolish to say these things, yet nobody laughs at them...ever Of course, if you're sober, drinkers can be annoying. their breath is overwhelming and they are loud, even obnoxious. But take a drink yourself 
    and all their annoying traits vanish.

    So where do you draw the line? If alcohol makes you feel loved and warm and comfy, why not stay drunk all the time? What does the physical deterioration, cold sweats, shakes and delirium tremens matter? Maybe you can sidestep these ail-ments by drinking only on the weekends, or limiting your weekly drinks, or not drink-ing before 4:00 pm. Even then, some pamphlet somewhere will tell you that you're a "problem" drinker, sooner or later, they might be right.But are you? Or is society just trying to bring you down? Are you being punished because a bunch of other folks can't handle their liquor? 
    <br><br>---------Sidetrack One: America, Land of Addiction: Our society itself is hopelessly addicted--not just to alcohol but to addiction itself. Once 21, a freshly legal drinker still has no counsel in the development of moderate habits. The French children have wine with dinner all through childhood, learning from the beginning to "go easy" lest they embarrass themselves at the dinner table. The American child is forbidden to drink at all. Only after his parents are gone to bed does he raid the liquor cabinet, drink too much and wind up in the hospital. His alcohol education is a concerned doctor's AA pamphlet. Before he even reaches the legal drinking age, he is pronounced an alcoholic. 
  <br><br>
  The more we tell the child to "just say no", the more seductive and intriguing "yes" becomes. The child grows up believing he has no self-control, and so must say "no" to everything instead of "Okay, just one." In America there is no such thing as "just one" whether it be potato chips, cigarettes, sexual partners or lines of cocaine. A shot of whiskey leads straight to alcoholism and then rehab, where Clockwork Orange-esque behavioral modi-fication techniques soon make one vomit at the taste of alcohol. We leave rehab "cured" but still governed by an addictive personality, only the revulsion and fear of a possible "relapse" outweighs our eternal thirst. This is called "successful treatment" yet one still has not learned the first thing about self-control, becoming instead a rehab addict: attending AA meeting twice daily, driving the family crazy with pious lectures about the evils of drink, all the while refusing to believe alcohol is completely innocent, that the power that causes so much ruin is our own weakness, and setfishness. 
  <br><br>In conclusion, the trick to living a full life with alcohol is knowing how to pace yourself. By steeling your reason against the liquid abyss, you can have a rip-roaring good time every weekend.

        It is a well known fact that slackers are much too con-cerned with work shirking and authority evasion to be bothered with such trivialities as health and wealth. Subsequent consumer goods have developed to suit the demands of this abberant culture, products which cater to the instant-gratification-takes-too-long mind-set.

<h2 >SINGLEHOOD, PART TWO:</h2> 
<h2 >THE END OF SINGLEHOOD</h2> 
<p class="justify">
Many of our readers have benefited from our past singles advice so much that they
are now no longer single. While we all congratulate these unfortunate, sexually satisfied
individuals, we can already feel them turning to us for advice. "How can I make it last?" 
or "Why don't I want it to?" Well, we got you into this jam, we'll get you out. In addition
to showing you fifty NEW ways to leave your lover. We'll show you one or two ways 
how not to. We'll show you how to keep the upper hand, and not end up insecure or itchy.
</p>
<br>
<h3>1. SUFFOCATION</h3> 
<p class="justify">
  As the layers of new love settle, one partner in romance tends
  to be less intense, less clingy and ga-ga than the other. It is then common for the other 
  partner to try to suffocate them back into their former state. Generally, the best advice 
  when being suffocated is to not thrash around, as this will only deepen your partner's 
  desire to "not let you go." Simply play dead until your partner goes to the bathroom, 
  then quickly get dressed and run off to join the Peace Corps. If you find yourself in the
  awkward position of being the suffocator, remember to apply pressure at the "trachea" -
 the vulnerable spot at the base of the neck between the collarbones.<br><br>
</p>
<h3>2. JEALOUSY</h3>
 <p class="justify">
  (How to make it work for you): If you get more attention from the opposite (or same) sex than your partner does, flaunt this in their face at every conceivable 
  opportunity. This will keep the balance of power tipped in your favor. If your partner 
  gets more attention, try to overcompensate with heavy drinking and self-pity. Whine 
  softly under your breath, stare moodily into your drink instead of being "socialble" at the
  next party you go to. If that doesn't get them to pay you more attention, go back to step one, suffocation.
 </p>
  <br><br>
   <h3>3. DISTANCE</h3> 
   <p class="justify">
   "Absence makes the heart grow fatter" as they say. Most slackers 
   prefer their mates to be absent, as this allows for an actual personality to be rearranged into something more compatible with the slacker's day-to-day fantasy land
   existence. For some, a hazy memory of a face and a reminiscence of a fun evening is
   preferable to actually being with a real person. For the slacker brave enough to try and
   stay in a relationship, "distancing" becomes necessary. Distancing, as defined in the 
   Slacker Dictionary, is "The art of removing one's emotion and attention from the object of
   one's affection." It should be employed whenever your partner begins to act "mature"
   and starts lecturing you to do the same. As this is bound to happen, it is important for
   slackers begin distancing themselves almost as soon as their new relationship begins. 
   When you and your new mate are being intimate, let your mind wander. think
   about all the other things you could be doing with your time. Respond to every question
   with "Huh?", every answer with "So?", and every declaration of love with "whatever."
  If you must say "I love you, too", be sure to add "I guess" to the end. When you're sitting there
  beside your lover, your mind racing miles away and if they make a foolish 
  attempt to "bridge" the gap by asking you what you're thinking of, maybe even offering 
  you a bribe of a penny, simply sigh and say "oh, nothing". If they persist in trying to 
  regain their closenesa, pretend your'e asleep. If that doesn't work, pretend you're dead.
  If that doesn't work, kill yourself (or them).
   </p>

    <h3>4. PARENTS</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      Meeting parents is a no-win situation. The nicer they are to you, the 
     less they really like you. Compensate for this by making your first impression a really
     horrible one. Grunt and wear oily clothes. Drink a lot and make lewd comments.This way,
     their expectations we be vastly lowered. From then on, the slightest attempt at 
     decency will be a pleasant surprise as opposed to the expected norm.</p><br><br>
     <h3>5. BIRTH CONTROL</h3>
     <p class="justify">
      In addition to security and love and all that, what a
      steady relationship really means is sex without condoms. The girl goes on the pill and
      the boy gives his dusty condoms away to his single friends, mocking them with unfettered
      glee. But then comes the eventual psychotic interludes that are bound to beset 
      the girl due to longterm pharmaceutical manipulation of her feminine hormones. The 
      slacker male can react to her irrational hysteria by either (A) being sympathetic, or (B) 
      convincing her she's completely insane. The one will bring him to his goal of 
      being "sensitive" but that can lead to trouble, as in being expected from then on to play 
      therapist for endless hours every time she falls apart. Here at the Procrastinator we
      suggest you try plan (B), which will enable you to get away with irrational, psychotic 
      behavior. The only drawback is that if she really believes you, she'll use it as 
      justification for eventual mutilation of your genitals.</p><br><br>
      <h3>5. MIND CONTROL</h3>
      <p class="justify">
      Relationships are a power struggle and the first 5 points mentioned are all about how to win it. 
      None of them, however, come close in importance to mind control. In a prolonged state of intimacy 
      with someone, many "channels" are opened between psyches, resulting in "mind-reading". You find 
      yourselves synchronistically uttering the same adages, understanding each other's nonverbal communication,
      and at a party knowing instinctively who in the crowded room has slept with each other. When the sort of
      rapport is in place, the new tug-of-war begins. Your best bet is to cloud your own mind and act contrary 
      to your instincts, and always do the wrong things. This way you will always be delightfully "unpredictable" 
      and your companion will be struggling to second guess and dominate you. Once this occurs, it's time to strike!
      Wait until your lover is at their most insecure and addled and then tell them in a very calm, certain monotone,
      "When are you going to realise you can't sing?" or "Why don't you just admit that, aside from me, you have no life?"
      You then reassure them that you won't leave, at least not in the next few hours, as long as they get their
      "act" together and buy you an expensive dinner. They will be convinced they can't live without you and you will 
      be in the luxurious position of deciding whether or not they survive.</p><br><br>
      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
      <p class="justify">
      Do these tactics seem a little harsh? Baby, you've got a lot to learn! Like the man says, "All's fair in Love & War, Sex & Violence,
      Seductive Whispers & Loud Threats". Put two and two together and you got four, and what else? A lot of tear-stained tissues, a television 
      left on all night, a little shot of whiskey ignored on the night table. You got a little blood, a few laughs and a crushing Visa bill,
      but that's life, as they say. Live alone and starve for love if you want and you'll save money. But if you want to play the game, be prepared to lose!
      Lose cash, maybe. But win the sex war, whatever your sex! Both sides win! Love and war are the same. Love the wargame you play with your loved one!
      It's natural to feel a little hostility along with the passion, right? Remember to play fair though, and use the little tips you learned here 
      only When you feel the balance of power is slipping to your opponent/partner's side. They'll be glad you did, too, because no one likes to have the 
      upper hand too long (like everything, it gets boring). Remember too that as long as you both keep your hearts open to the love you share, all the bullshit
      and petty fighting will pose no threat to your relationship, but will rather provide an amusing way to pass the time between your sexual interludes. Peace!

    <h2>TIE-DYE FEVER: CATCH IT!</h2>
    <p class="justify">
    Who would have thought that in 1994 a person could be so completely 
    mesmerized by a practice that was only marginally popular in the 
    1960's.  The art of tye-dying has existed for many years and has 
    been a symbol of rebellion and counter cultural activities for the 
    past thirty or so years.  But for those that have mastered the art 
    it has simply become the perfect tool to separate the stoned masses 
    in hippydom from their hardly earned monies. As an undercover member 
    of this fraudulent mass I learned a valuable lesson or two. As I 
    transferred from one world to the next I tried to peer through the 
    bright psychedelic colors to examine the real deals draped behind a 
    rigid wall of peace, love, and sappiness. I was prepared for my 
    journey, tyedyes in hand, and ready to face the furious heat of 
    TIE-DYE FEVER.
    <br><br>
    The car was packed and we were ready to roll. The cast was made up 
    of a plethora of talent that included: Lisa Bergman; a comedic 
    Jewish-mother-wanna-be in search of fame, fun, and a husband with 
    a knack for spending. Don Martin; a long time tyedye warrior, funny 
    man, and as we later learned,  purveyor of a host of curious foul 
    emanations.  Beth Katz; a power driver and provider of the backing  
    laugh track for our journey.  And me Scott Lehr ; undercover 
    journalist for the Procrastinator.  
    <br><br>
    The first thing we needed to do was assimilate into the kingdom;
    "Hippydom".   Our plan was simple, drive all night, don't shower 
  (thus developing a unique stench) and devour a case of beer before 
  10am the next morning.  This strategy worked to perfection. With the 
  help of the powerful sun, a toke from the peace pipe, and the   
  </div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
  <p class="justify"> 
    previously mentioned enhancements,  by noon I was as blasted and 
    burnt as the rest of the population. It was now time for the games 
    to begin.
    With someone else's trusty dog at my side, Don guarding our home 
  base, and the girls securing the alcohol for the days consumption; 
  I set out to explore the treacherous surroundings.  There were 
  venders everywhere!  Some were selling tiedyes, some veggie 
  sandwiches, there were hippie beads, anything you could possibly 
  want and most things you definitely did not want.  Each vender sold 
  and smelled like something different.  Living in New York City it is 
  hard to imagine buying food from a dirtier place than some of the 
  roach filled fine dining establishments around here.  Places where 
  the roaches are so bold as to snatch food right out of your hands, 
  eat it in front of you, take out your wallet pay the bill and leave 
  an enormous tip.  But in "Hippydom" you can find and buy food 
  straight out of the hands of someone who hasn't showered in years!  
  The great thing is that they don't try to hide it, in fact they 
  advertise it.  In one glorious little shop they were selling the 
  Deadhead favorite called Hepatitios.  Hepatitos: 25% vegetables, 
  25%  dog, 25% disease (Hepatitis), and 25 % delicious.  That's 100% 
  profit, and of course all of these establishments passed all 
  pertinent FDA regulations.
  One thing that I noticed was that everyone was very friendly, and 
  gullible.  Had Don and I been selling used cars to this same group 
  in a slightly higher tax bracket there would have been a huge number 
  of people driving home in brand new psychedelic lemons (or calling 
  tow trucks).  Actually the quality of our tyedyes were quite high 
  therefore any line of bullshit was easily believed.  In fact a 
  neighboring dogs urine was easily disguised as recently spilled 
  beer and the damp T-shirts went just as fast.
 </p> </div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
  <p class="justify"> 
    As the day poured on the sun an alcohol had reduced us to drooling 
  idiots, and that made business even better.  Both girls took the 
  opportunity to pass out as Don and I continued to push our "mecca 
  bright" shirts.  It was closing in on show time and we needed to 
  get a prime location. Money was on our minds.  It was in this new 
  location where we encountered the grilled cheese nazi. This woman 
  had all the class and tact of a NYC taxi driver, and that was by 
  far her most charming characteristic.  She was blurting out commands 
  to the stoned hungry masses like a impatient broadway choreographer. 
  "Step in line people", "we are eating, lets get it together." She 
  was literally wearing the pants in her group, we knew this because 
  all of the males were wearing skirts. Don finally told her to shut 
  up and war was declared but hat is a story for another time.  Now 
  we were in place and the show had begun.
  It is this quiet time, when you have the chance to reflect, that you 
  can see what is really going on in these places. Besides the smells, 
  the drugs, and the stupidity there is underlying theme. The theme is 
  profit.  The hippycrits will sell anything! preach to you about love 
  and brotherhood while they make a 75% profit on poor unsuspecting 
  morons.  I knew it had to be something besides the music.  It was 
  this glorious discovery and my becoming one with my surroundings 
  that prompted me to pass out for 20 minutes waking up with a severe 
  hangover. Don quickly fed me beer and as the show began  I was a new 
  a man and had one thing in mind: Sell! Sell! Sell!
  </p>   </div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
  <p class="justify"> 
    There was an exodus from the show of biblical proportions.  The 
  masses stumbled about our little set up.  I had everything in 
  control and the drooling hordes were eating out of the palms of my 
  hands. Shirts were flying out of there like a 50% off sale in the 
  Paramus mall.  I was barking out commands. "$10 T-shirts baby check 
  it out, check it out!"  " Hey, you step on it you bought it !"  Don 
  following my lead said nothing and continued supplying the beers.  
  It was a huge success.  Even the grilled cheese nazi was overwhelmed 
  with joy. As the crowd began to disperse we all relaxed, drank, and 
  spoke of the good old days when we last slept.  Yes it was all 
  becoming clearer; I had caught tiedye fever and it felt pretty good.
  <br><br>
  When we made it back to the car, our faces sore from constant 
  laughter, we knew we would not soon forget this wonderful trip.  
  The smell in the car would prevent us from that.  We managed to 
  escape the parking lot unscathed and headed happily back to the 
  city. The night ahead would bring us sleep, ahh true bliss! Even 
  locking the keys in the car could not put a frown on our smiling 
  faces. It was "hippydom" in all its glory that was on our minds. 
  It was the bright summer sun, the smell of feet floating ever so 
  lightly in the air, it was the psychedelic colors, the hepatitos 
  in our stomachs and the money in our pockets. It was soothing 
  warmth of irresponsibility, it was irrepressible, irresistible 
  comforting high, It was Tiedye Fever and it was spreading.

<h3>The Definitive</h3> 
<h2>MEXICAN MUD FIELD GUIDE</h2> 
<p class="justify">
  What is it to be a Mud Man? What does it take to lock oneself in a 
  stuffy van with 4 very smelly young men for 8, 10 hours at a time 
  to arrive to sometimes cheesy, self-absorbed, and surly (or worse, sparse)
   crowds? Who knows? These men sleep in empty beer and guitar cases and are 
   forced to scavenge Denny's salad bars in the search of the ultimate 
   crowd. They're actually quite bright fellows (mostly) and their witty 
   banter often fills bars with cacophonic guffaws and chortles, usually Dave's. 
   Should any of you readers become stuck in a room with one of the Mexican Mud 
   mensches. It may become awkwardly appropriate to communicate verbally. Perhaps 
   to inform them that they have stolen your drink, and you would like it back.

   <br><br>
   <h3>GLOSSARY:</h3>
   <p class="justify">
    Each Mud member has a language (and a world) of his own, but they all sponge 
    each others conversation hooks like to many funk riffs. Sometimes they become 
    so syncophantic, they start to eerily resemble each other. It can get pretty frightening.
    <br><br> 
FLOUNDERING - When a performance is hindered by a musician's lack of talent or surplus of liquor.
<br><br> 
NOODLING - When a musician turns an inspired solo into a scale/riff exercise. Usually occurs when 
a musician has a surplus of bourbon and/or a shortage of spectators. 
<br><br> 
SCHRALP - Patented Czujism for a guitar lick e.g. "Hey Schwangly, those are some 
shreddy schralps yer layin' out" Note: there is a whole Czuj language of "Sch"-isms
that are far too esoteric and sophisticated to deconstruct here.

<h3>BEHAVIORAL ABERRATIONS</h3>
<p class="justify">
  The Mud, like any decent band, is very weird. Judging their individual moods can be 
fun, tedious or annoying. Although somewhat complex complex, they can still be
defined in three categories:<br><br>
1. BEHAVIOR: The goofy, "Party on", off-duty whimsy<br>
TREATMENT: Get them drunk, stoned, chat away<br><br>
2. BEHAVIOR: The reticent "I just played I'm tired, go away" shell<br>
TREATMENT: Let them cry to their girlfriends<br>
3. BEHAVIOR: The Rock one Roll Demigod know-it-all pedestal<br>
TREATMENT: Slap'em until they return to behavior 1<br><br>
</p>
<h3>SOME CATCH PHRASES</h3>
<p class="justify">
  Like most people, the Mud would like to feel that people assimilate to their
   cavorting, so in order to entice one of the Mud members into a conversation, 
   use some of these pseudo-toady lures (these expressions subject to change 
   according to Mud's current favorite movie/song/TV show of the week): 
<br>
Dave: "Yo, whaddup?"<br>
Marc: "Hey schwanglyman, how's it hanging?"<br>
Scott: "Yo, whaddup"<br>
Don: "Light me, babe"<br>
Matt: "Hello [your name here]"

    <h2>SCIENTISTS PROVE IT!!! BREATHING FOUND FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL LIFE</h2> 
    <p class="justify">
    "The lungs on other creatures are sometimes less tasteful than they are on ours, 
    but they're just as dependent on breathing as human lungs," commented a bewildered 
    official, before he reddened and quickly added, "I think I meant that the other way 
    around." When asked which way around the official intended, he deferred his definition 
    of "good taste" to the lung creatures in question, who ignored him, sadly, continuing 
    to merely breathe in and out, as if nothing had occurred. "They was a like a bunch o' 
    them goddamned zen buddhists all watchin' me there." noted an outragod New Jersey resident. 
    Yet no matter how badly the facts are garbled, the message to earth people is sadly clear, 
    and growing even saddeningly clear with each fatefully impending breath: DEATH AWAITS! 
    Come, come to death! It's "cool" to be dead.<br><br> 
    "Not even immortality is certain if this is true" a certain successful film critic noted. Already there are groups of upset fans who have decided to give up the fight, and yet can't seem to.<br>
    "The darn thing is, it's impossible to not breathe without dying," was one brilliant phlosopher's observation. 
    Still, many are hopeful and none no more so than your friends here at the Procrastinator! In the meantime 
    remember: "Breathe daily for good health!"

    1. THE PERSONAL (TECHNICAL) RIDER<br> 
  When a band establishes a performance contract with a particular 
  venue (bar, fraternity, stadium etc.), it is common that along with
   the actual payment for the performance, the managers of the establishment 
   will provide the artists with a predetermined assortment of backstage treats
   (food, drink, etc/) as a gesture of noblesse oblige to make the musicians feel at 
   home and perhaps enhance their performance. The form that establishes the specific
   comforts required is called the personal rider. (Mexican Mud Rider available
   upon request):<br><br>

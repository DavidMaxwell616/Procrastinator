          <h2>THE 1994 ANNUAL PROCRASTINATOR AWARDS!</h2>
          <p class="justify">Yes, it's the time of the year when slackers everywhere shed their flannels and 
            don tuxedos before heading off to Jersey to the gala 24th. annual 
            <h2>PROCRASTINATOR AWARDS</h2> 
            <p class="justify">This year's line-up of dim stars and has-been-before-they-beens include Don Martin, Scott Lehr 
            and John "I forgot my tuxedo, man" LaGreco. We'll also see fetching starlets as the notorious Tracy Measy, 
            the demure Patty Headstrong and the sultry Ida Vennyboddy. The big press is of course, Doctor Twilight's scandal-ridden 
            bowing-out of acting as host for this year's ceremony, due to an unfortunate case of insufficient alcohol-poisoning. 
            In his place, the unrelenting Procrastinator academy searched high and low, and then just picked whoever was closest to them 
            on the couch (in order to get rid of them and make more room), that hapless announcer for this year's ceremony will be a 
            bag of cheese-doodles!<br><br>

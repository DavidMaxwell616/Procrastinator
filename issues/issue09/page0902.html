        <h2>ALIENS STOLE EDDIE MURPHY'S TALENT!</h2> 
        <p class="justify">Top lawyers for Mr. Murphy have now officially filed suit against a mysterious 
        Swiss corporation that they claim has shoplifted Eddie's talent to the aliens in 
        exchange for chemical technology. "This is a groundbreaking case" the lawyer 
        said with some certainty. "If we could actually recover his talent we might lessen 
        the banality of our future comedic cinema!" While the aliens have not yet come 
        forward to answer any charges, the lawyers are fairly certain that when they do, 
        they'll answer them like Buckwheat. "The aliens pay good money to learn to do 
        Buckwheat Impressions." says Timothy Ithay, UFO Specialist, "They first fell in 
        love with from SNL skits via our satellites. It is a popular belief that ever
        since the aliens began to receive television and radio signals, they have worked 
        to arrange accidental "deaths" for their favorite singers and entertainers. In order 
        to bring their souls to the aliens' planet. But it wasn't until the mid-1970's that the 
        aliens developed a system to leave the body behind and merely abduct the talent, 
        thereby saving transport costs. Most stars dont recognize the danger, but the 
        fact is, if the aliens catch your act on satellite and recognize you have a "rare" talent,
        they'll steal it, leaving you a has-been burden to the quality-starved entertainment 
        consumers of Earth. *
        </p>
         <div class="col-sm-7">
          <p class="justify"> This is a historic case because it is the first time someone has sued the aliens 
        for theft of talent. It will be impossible to say if the alerts are going to feel obligated 
        to return the talent, or if it is even possible. The fate of mankind could be disasterous 
        if Eddie's talent is not recovered shortly. Already a script Is being put together for Beverly 
        Hills Cop 4, and in the fall, according to Mr. Murphy's publicist, he will begin recording a 
        new album, "showcasing a new, even more mature direction in light soul-pop." Since Eddie
        has no plans to spare us his media presence in the future, we can only  pray that the aliens
        will show us the compassion of restoring at least some of his irreverent genius.

          <h2>GLOBAL WARFARE LINKED TO MUD LYRICS</h2> 
          <p class="justify">According to a recently released bulletin from the Social-Studies Network. 
            All the problems in the world may in fed stem from the vulgarity of lyrics to the Mexican Mud 
            Band's song "Beastie". Masses huddled and mourners moaned upon Dave (head of the Mud Band) 
            Parsons comment that regardless of this horrifying revelation, the song would not be altered
            in any way. "That's the sad truth of it" commented the recently-rescued-from-premature-baldness
            star. "Beastie really does like to do all the things I've described. To deny what he does would only encourage him."

            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p class="justify">When the citizens of the world could finally be reached for comment, they hurled a vicious stream of 
            multi-lingual epithets. The translator summed it up beautifully at the end of a ninety-day seminar 
            on "Coping With Awareness" at which several earth dwellIng officials were rumored to have been spotted 
            (and then more property moistened) "No matter what pointless offense might be causing the bloodshed, 
            we see no reason to discontinue it at this time," assured of their mutual destruction, the people 
            seemed ready to forgive Parsons for the damning lyrics and return home, relieved and wobbly.

    of Althea, 1921. I can see them now; their brave little hands clutching those miniature, 
    inadequate life-preservers; their indominatable munchkinland spirit carrying their souls 
    aloft, even as their midget bodies went spiraling down forever to a briny rest in Davy-Jones's 
    locker. Aye, that was the year my grand-daughter was to have been born, god-bless the condom

          <h1>JIM MORRISON RISES FROM GRAVE, ISSUES WARNING</h1> 
          <br><i>Legendary rock idol Jim Morrison returns from dead, announces 3 year deal with TCC</i> 
          <br><br>
          <p class="justify">"I was only waiting for the vile Republicans to leave the power-seat", he intoned with his 
            usual mystique, "but now I must awake from the deep sleep of the damned for a more 
            important reason than mere freedom fo expose myself on stage. I must warn you all 
            that if Michael Jackson is allowed to continue his affair with the Presley girl, Elvis 
            himself will rise from the grave and summon all his followers, and there will be an 
            army of living dead Elvis fans who will march upon Neverland and destroy him."
            <br><br>
            According to Jackson Insiders, the shy puer aeturnus of bad music is preparing for 
            this attack by sending his personal submarine down to waken Japanese film star Godzilla
            (longtime companion of Mr Jackson) from his prehistoric slumber. "Dealing with the living dead 
            is old hat for Michael" confided one of a particularly loathsome group of llama handlers currently 
            staying at Jackson's home. "Only with someone of Elvis's stature, well, Michael just wants Godzilla 
            at his side for support."<br><br>

          remember. He then proceeded to argue that his title as "the lizard king" automatically made Godzilla 
          his subject and therefore Jim was entitled to all the whiskey made in Kentucky. Within minutes of 
          consuming his first snot, the icon was dead again. Lawyers for the TCC corporate are planning to go 
          to hell to sue for breach of contract.

          <p class="justify">The universe has been revealed at last and it is broke. 
          God addressed a visibly nervous throng outside the steps of 
          the U N. today, saying that due to massive blunders in economic 
          thinking, the universe is inn debt over its collective ears. "I 
          can't quite explain the nature of the debt," God revealed, "but 
          if you can imagine all the trillions of stars in space and the rate 
          the universe is expanding, and mutiply that by a fixed mortgage rate 
          of 12.5% accumulating compounded interest for over 200 billion years, well,

            personal accounting staff, each of the inhabited planets in the universe
            is required to pay the equivalent of 3.5 trillion dollars every other millennia.
             God then added that the reason our recorded civilization is under a million years
              old is due to the his last visit being so "disappointing" as the as earth's 
              inhabitants obey to pay. "The universe is a dangerous place and if you want to live

             I get the money by Friday, or else in three million years the only evidence of human 
             existence the next inhabitants of this planet will find will be the body of missing

             a small breed of teamsters to be exhibited at a mysterious island amusement park."<br><br>
             If the U.N. will heed this threat, God only knows, and he's the one making it in

            an alternative to cloning Hoffa, who, "although a great organizer of labor, lacks the charisma 
            and athletic ability to be a successful amusement park exhibit." According to the president, 
            "therefore (Ms. Retton's) DNA would better serve to illustrate what was best about mankind: 
            its unconquerable human spirit and spunky, good-humored determination to transcend physical,

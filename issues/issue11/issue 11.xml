In what can only be called the single most outrageous, blatantly uninformed statement of this century, a rival rock-band newsletter recently accused the PROCRASTINATOR — your friend and official fanzine of the Mexican Mud Band — of writing "self-obsessed, meandering, poorly structured, socially unconscionable essays that achieve nothing in the way of promotion or value." We here at the Procrastinator are deeply mortified, appalled and...wounded. Do our meaningless articles seem to 
be about nothing, or isn't being "about" nothing what "being" is all about? Otherwise what are we being, being Beings? The answer is Beings are meant to be Nothing. To be about Nothing is to be about Being. All who are being will be nothing and all that is nothing will be being. And thus to be a being writing about nothing is to circum-vent the circle, and that's like triple beaming! So there, Mr. ski-capped critic! 
These untalented fosterers of so-called "good" journalism who laugh 
at us, they are like ancient dinosaurs laughing at the first furred rodent. We would laugh at them, but, alas are too full. Instead, we may lean back in our rockers, pat the vial of sedatives at out sides, and mutter, "There's them that laugh, and there's them that knows better." 
If our lack of interesting things to say makes you mad, good. We've been encouraging work from all our readers, but no one has anything to say beyond "Dear Mud. Please put me on your newsletter mailing 
list." So, get mad and send us scathing reviews. Send us your entries and win fantastic prizes. See the Abe E. Piece Foundation Literacy Contest information listed below. See Amelia, the hamburger boy who dances the Charleston. See Elmo, the hair-lipped elm-tree with a lisp who can solve any trigonometry problem known to man! Stump him and win a big elm log to take home for your fire! Remember what Zealot McDougal says, "If you're the type who can't type, then write!!" 
WIN THE PROCRASTINATO "PIECE" PRIZE! 
"Creativity is wasted in the minds of the young, and young in the minds of the wasted." - Abe E. Piece 
In honor of the fourteenth year of the passing of our honorable "spiritual" guide, Abe E. Piece, we present the literary contest that bears his name. Abe E. was a sham shaman, but he had the obtuse mind of a profoundly long-winded and uninteresting Marxism professor, and those who man-aged to stay awake through one his harangues were often rewarded with an occasional jest or flatulence joke. He was assassinated by Lithuanian mimes in 1976, a harsh fact omitted from most high-school text-books, which still portray these anarchic street performers as gentle, misunder-stood simpletons. His dream was to upset the Paris entertainment aristoc-racy and create a new order of amusement, a world where mime was despised and irreverence and cantankerous ambivalence were the sure-fire laugh-getters of the day. In order to keep those odious mimes on the run, we at the foundation that bears his great name, are offering for the 14th consecutive year since his gruesome, lonely death, the three tier cre-ative writing contest that bears his all-but-forgotten family name, the Procrastinator "Piece" prize. 
AWARDS FOR BEST IN POETRY, SHORT FICTION and ESSAY 
ONE: POETRY. On a somewhat clean piece of paper, write a poem of moving depth and honesty on one or all of the following topics: a) Broken dreams; broken bottles; b) the unfathomably vast amount of words in the English language; c) the tragic problem of immigrant Lithuanian mimes in America circa 1980, or d) none of the above

DECEMBER 
HOROSCOP 
by Serge Divider 
SCORPIO: Ignore the holiday season, I foresee great disappointment under your tree. Your mate got hungry and ate your present. Turn your your inner cable to the home shopping network and select a less zircon-encrusted goal. Your designated religious gift-giver will materialize in a brief hallucination on your way to work, sometime before the 24th. 
SAGITTARIUS: The time to be gentle with your lover has long passed. Handcuffs and stem discipline are what's needed, not pop psychology and tenderness. Avoid giving change to skinny men in red suits around the 25th. Computer literacy is in your future, along with a stuttering proi)- lem and several tedious phone calls (one from a heavily-slurred Aries on the 5th) 
CAPRICORN: You'd like to sleep the whole month away, but since you can't close your eyes without hallucinating demons, the second best bet would be to just make bird noises quietly in the comer until everybody has left, then you can quietly set the demons free, and sleep. (Remember to wake up this twenty-fourth, as the yule log will be on TV.) 
AQUARIUS: All your friends are getting pretty damn tired of your horse-like laugh. Why don't you learn an amusing accent? Maybe perfecting a Marlon Brando or Mario Thomas imitation could take the irritating shrill-ness out of your voice. Try to stick your finger in a light-socket sometime during the week of the 12th. 
PISCES: Your car will wind up in the shop needing expensive repairs. Crash it now, and collect the insurance. Avoid being pan-fried and eaten 
on a bed of rice during the week of the 8th. ARIES: Stay aloof when locked in a room with an arrogant young Gemini 
this LIIIJ I I . 
TAURUS: You shouldn't have tried to "one-last-time" sleep with that cute but vindictive ex of yours. Shouldn't-a couldn't-a, wouldn't-a. Now its too late to explain how alcohol made you into a sex and attention starved fool, thrilled beyond rational thought by the distorted memories of fantastic lovemaking, there's nobody there to listen. Now all your friends despise you. Make vague plans to go to Europe this spring (but don't go). Do not order what the man next you is eating when taking your current love out for a reconciliatory dinner later in the week of the 18th. 
GEMINI: Your life goal was to own the biggest of everything. Face up to it: all you'll ever own is the biggest headache and the biggest ego. A chance might open up to kill your therapist during a session late this month. Don't eat more than two percodans during your depression bout early on the morning of the 25th. 
Ci,NCER: A promised Christmas bonus is revoked by your boss. Avoid suspiciously inexpensive hand-guns when you go shopping for vengeance on the lower east side this 20th. 
LEO: That hole you've been digging for your neighbor's shrilly-barking dog is finally ready. Time to fill it up before the first frost. A trail of ham-burger leading under your fence and into the hole should do it. This little bit of cold-heartedness will serve as good practice for when you are lured into the fast-paced world of New York advertising on or about the 15th of next month. 
VIRGO: Your initial doubts about the sanity of your new roommate will prove to be correct. Take precautions now before your distrust evapo-rates. Try switching to decaffeinated coffee for the week of the 15th. 
LIBRA: You won't win the lottery this month, but buy the tickets anyway. Even though it's not required, wearing a haimet at work will win you the notice of your anally-retentive supervisor.

        <h1>INTERVIEW WITH DAVE PARSONS!</h1> <br>
        <p class="justify">
        Dave is late for our interview. Dave, as it turns out, is late for everything. He's late for his own trial for lateness. He waits in the back until someone calls for him and then he approaches the bench, sad and hollow-eyed, his voice wracked with grave reproach.

      JUDGE: Son, like a mountain, you have been judged tardy, a tardiness that spans eternity, for not just to this courtroom and its measly trial by jury were you tardy, but throughout life. Whenever a meeting was called, you were tardy there too. And when you were sprawled on the cement and flying like an angel overhead, you were tardy in returning to your gravely fallen form and wound up in the hospital, strapped to a bed. And later, and even later the tardiness grew stronger in thee, even as you became famed for tardiness, then abhorred for it. <br><br>
DAVE: (long pause) <br><br>
JUDGE: Well, this is typical.

      "He was a bastard, his grease-paint face plastered my ceiling, sent me reeling, do you think I was heeding my soggy Irish mom's back-door pleadings as I slammed by, surly, high off steroids, guns, spermicide and turns, bruised her varicosed, gross thigh, almost threw up from the after-wilt of it, congratulated the stalwart stasis of my shattered stomach and bent not lower but up above it, crying as the gastritis sled me like a bag of chips, like a pill that sits within the hollow of your deepest need, the one kept beneath your stash of sleep and jewelry, under the skulls of count-less victims, lower than the basest urge on girl-less, lost weekends...rea-son outvoted, total slack a great beyond that you'd surrounded, beat and meet by the side of side's outside challenge? Do you think I was heeding her shushed whisper to not annoy the mimes? I was too disgusted by their fake smiles." said a breathless 8 year old Quentin Stunado of Southeast Orange, NJ. When asked to elaborate his position on the politics of mimery, he added:<br><br> 
      "Bake like Sandy Sara Froster cake that ate the plate of yesterday's waste and cried beside the great divide, that sighed only when locked inside the mile-long mall, where you as a baby first crawled, and shopped with tooth and grin since money was absent, and cried like a stranded waif, shriek-ing mommy at the top of your lungs, and back down into the beneath, bringing hideous green bud where ashes meant to be, bringing ugly me, like an avenging phantom upon your family tree, bringing rotted harvest, and breaking free, from the past, slamming down an empty glass, and here's where the wise man leaves, and the leaves of autumn are wise until the man rakes them, the leaves of the wise man, the leaves of the

The mime could not be reached for comment.

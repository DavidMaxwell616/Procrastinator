            <p class="justify">In what can only be called the single most outrageous, blatantly uninformed statement of this century, a rival rock-band newsletter recently accused the PROCRASTINATOR — your friend and official fanzine of the Mexican Mud Band — of writing "self-obsessed, meandering, poorly structured, socially unconscionable essays that achieve nothing in the way of promotion or value." We here at the Procrastinator are deeply mortified, appalled and...wounded. Do our meaningless articles seem to

                be about nothing, or isn't being "about" nothing what "being" is all about? Otherwise what are we being, being Beings? The answer is Beings are meant to be Nothing. 
                To be about Nothing is to be about Being. All who are being will be nothing and all that is nothing will be being. And thus to be a being writing about nothing is to

                  at us, they are like ancient dinosaurs laughing at the first furred rodent. We would laugh at them, but, alas are too full. Instead, we may lean back in our rockers, pat the vial of sedatives at out sides, and mutter, "There's them that laugh, and there's them that knows better."

  WIN THE PROCRASTINATOR "PIECE" PRIZE! 
</b></h2> 
<i>"Creativity is wasted in the minds of the young, and young in the minds of the wasted." </i><br> - Abe E. Piece
<br><br>
<p class="justify">
  In honor of the fourteenth year of the passing of our honorable "spiritual" guide, Abe E. Piece, we present the literary contest that bears his name. Abe E. was a sham shaman, but he had the obtuse mind of a profoundly long-winded and uninteresting Marxism professor, and those who managed to stay awake through one his harangues were often rewarded with an occasional jest or flatulence joke. He was assassinated by Lithuanian mimes in 1976, a harsh fact omitted from most high-school text-books, which still portray these anarchic street performers as gentle, misunderstood simpletons. His dream was to upset the Paris entertainment aristocracy and create a new order of amusement, a world where mime was despised and irreverence and cantankerous ambivalence were the sure-fire laugh-getters of the day. In order to keep those odious mimes on the run, we at the foundation that bears his great name, are offering for the 14th consecutive year since his gruesome, lonely death, the three tier creative writing contest that bears his all-but-forgotten family name, the Procrastinator "Piece" prize.

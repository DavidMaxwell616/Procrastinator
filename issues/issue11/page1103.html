        <h1 class="invert">DECEMBER HOROSCOPE<BR> 
          by Serge Divider </u></h1>
<p class="justify">
  SCORPIO: Ignore the holiday season, I foresee great disappointment under your tree. Your mate got hungry and ate your present. Turn your your inner cable to the home shopping network and select a less zircon-encrusted goal. Your designated religious gift-giver will materialize in a brief hallucination on your way to work, sometime before the 24th.<BR><BR> 
  SAGITTARIUS: The time to be gentle with your lover has long passed. Handcuffs and stem discipline are what's needed, not pop psychology and tenderness. Avoid giving change to skinny men in red suits around the 25th. Computer literacy is in your future, along with a stuttering proi)- lem and several tedious phone calls (one from a heavily-slurred Aries on the 5th) <BR><BR>
  CAPRICORN: You'd like to sleep the whole month away, but since you can't close your eyes without hallucinating demons, the second best bet would be to just make bird noises quietly in the comer until everybody has left, then you can quietly set the demons free, and sleep. (Remember to wake up this twenty-fourth, as the yule log will be on TV.) <BR><BR>
  AQUARIUS: All your friends are getting pretty damn tired of your horse-like laugh. Why don't you learn an amusing accent? Maybe perfecting a Marlon Brando or Mario Thomas imitation could take the irritating shrill-ness out of your voice. Try to stick your finger in a light-socket sometime during the week of the 12th. 
  PISCES: Your car will wind up in the shop needing expensive repairs. Crash it now, and collect the insurance. Avoid being pan-fried and eaten on a bed of rice during the week of the 8th.<BR><BR> 
  ARIES: Stay aloof when locked in a room with an arrogant young Gemini this 11th.

  <p class="justify">
    TAURUS: You shouldn't have tried to "one-last-time" sleep with that cute but vindictive ex of yours. 
    Shouldn't-a couldn't-a, wouldn't-a. Now its too late to explain how alcohol made you into a sex and 
    attention starved fool, thrilled beyond rational thought by the distorted memories of fantastic lovemaking, 
    there's nobody there to listen. Now all your friends despise you. 
    Make vague plans to go to Europe this spring (but don't go). Do not order what the man next you is eating when taking your current love out for a reconciliatory dinner later in the week of the 18th.<BR><BR> 
    GEMINI: Your life goal was to own the biggest of everything. Face up to it: all you'll ever own is the biggest headache and the biggest ego. A chance might open up to kill your therapist during a session late this month. Don't eat more than two percodans during your depression bout early on the morning of the 25th.<BR><BR> 
    CANCER: A promised Christmas bonus is revoked by your boss. Avoid suspiciously inexpensive hand-guns when you go shopping for vengeance on the lower east side this 20th.<BR><BR> 
    LEO: That hole you've been digging for your neighbor's shrilly-barking dog is finally ready. Time to fill it up before the first frost. A trail of hamburger leading under your fence and into the hole should do it. 
    This little bit of cold-heartedness will serve as good practice for when you are lured into the fast-paced world of New York advertising on or about the 15th of next month. <BR><BR>
    VIRGO: Your initial doubts about the sanity of your new roommate will prove to be correct. Take precautions now before your distrust evapo-rates. Try switching to decaffeinated coffee for the week of the 15th.<BR><BR> 
    LIBRA: You won't win the lottery this month, but buy the tickets anyway. Even though it's not required, wearing a haimet at work will win you the notice of your anally-retentive supervisor.

            Gorgeous WF seeks wealthy, near-sighted, middle-aged New Yorker to supply me with the good life in exchange for letting him hold my hand in public. Once he's invested over $1,000 in dinners and plays, I'll let him come up to my apartment and wait on the couch for over an hour while I change into sweatpants. I will then heighten his sense of sexual insecurity through the use of intentionally conflicting signals.
